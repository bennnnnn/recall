# Physics review — 2026-10-04

Review baseline: `origin/main` at the start of this review. The physics suite had
3,238 passing tests. Its school corpus answered all 132 questions correctly; the
coverage floor was 131. These figures describe the maintained examples, not every
possible phrasing or every topic supported by SymPy.

## Topic inventory

The baseline catalog contains 282 operations across 20 solver kinds, 111 with
word-problem bindings and 89 with catalog-owned arithmetic expressions. Catalog
registration checks solver ownership; binding tests exercise every declared input set.

| Kind | Operations | Scope |
|---|---:|---|
| Thermal | 40 | Heat, phase change, gases, kinetic theory, thermodynamics |
| Circuit | 36 | DC, capacitors, inductors, RC/RL, AC and transformers |
| Modern | 34 | Photons, photoelectric effect, nuclear decay, relativity, atomic levels |
| Fluids | 23 | Pressure, flow, buoyancy, viscosity and capillarity |
| Magnetism | 20 | Fields, magnetic forces and induction |
| Rotation | 16 | Angular motion, inertia, rolling and angular momentum |
| Optics | 15 | Lenses, mirrors, refraction, diffraction and interference |
| Waves | 13 | Propagation, resonance, Doppler and sound |
| Kinematics | 12 | Constant motion, gravity and rates |
| Gravitation | 10 | Gravity, orbital motion and escape speed |
| Energy | 9 | Work, power, kinetic/potential energy and conservation |
| Circular | 9 | Circular motion and related constraints |
| Spring | 8 | Hooke's law, spring energy and oscillation quantities |
| Force | 7 | Force balance, weight and tension |
| Friction | 6 | Normal force, friction, limiting equilibrium and incline motion |
| Materials | 6 | Elasticity and stress/strain |
| Projectile | 5 | Trajectories and launch quantities |
| SUVAT | 5 | Constant-acceleration rearrangements |
| Momentum | 4 | Momentum, impulse, collision and recoil |
| Torque | 4 | Moments and lever balance |

## Correctness findings

The independent Bugbot review reproduced three P1 issues and eight P2 issues.
The companion correctness and animation PRs address these cases with regression tests.

- Static friction was returned as its maximum `mu*N` instead of the equilibrium
  force. Resting 5 kg, 20 degrees, `mu_s=0.4`: 18.4 N versus 16.8 N required.
- Sliding state and direction were lost. Downhill 10 degrees, `mu_k=0.5`:
  0 versus -3.13 m/s². Uphill 30 degrees, `mu_k=0.2`: 3.21 versus 6.60 m/s² downhill.
- SUVAT distance after reversal was displacement. `u=10`, `a=-2`, `t=10`:
  0 m versus 50 m travelled.
- Collision arithmetic used SI values but its substitution printed raw mixed units.
- Vertical launches produced zero-width scenes and lost the scalar answer.
- Atwood masses were sorted before conversion, reversing the intended magnitude.
- Vector endpoints in negative quadrants were outside the scene bounds.
- Work/height annotations used physical lengths within fixed display bounds;
  potential-energy ground crossed the suspended body.
- Four-decimal SI rounding collapsed micrometre orbits to a stationary point.
- Replacing one moving scene with another retained the previous animation progress.
- A single fixed playback duration concealed changes to physical timescales.

Review of the implementations also caught decimal-token precision loss, symbolic
eigensystems with unstated exceptional parameters, ODE families missing coefficient
and solution-domain conditions, a false displacement/distance formula equivalence,
initial rest mistaken for current equilibrium, zero amplitude treated as unspecified,
and harmonic velocity arrows at zero-velocity turning points. Regression tests cover
these cases. Numeric eigensystems and conditional linear ODE families define the
supported symbolic boundary; unsupported exceptional branches decline.

## Structure and extensions

Keep the catalog as the owner of numerical laws and assumptions. Extractors bind
words and dimensions; pure solvers compute in SI; presentation reads those exact
results. Shared law binding and the bounded symbolic executor are useful common
infrastructure. Physics must not reach through math's private solver modules.

The new explicit-model path adds algebra/systems, simplification, differentiation,
integration, conditional linear ODE general solutions, Cartesian vector calculus, vector products and
numeric matrix eigensystems. Decimal tokens retain exact precision. ODE leading-coefficient,
discriminant and generated singularity conditions are explicit; unsupported nonlinear
or parameterized variable-coefficient equations and symbolic eigensystems decline.
Parameterized algebra supports affine equations with fixed coefficients. Systems whose
rank or degree depends on an unconstrained coefficient decline, including `a*x=0`;
substitution alone cannot prove completeness at singular coefficient values.
The parser, operation solver and schema remain separate from
numeric word-problem extraction. Exact input/output binding prevents an old symbolic
result from answering a changed request.

## Remaining SymPy-capable coverage

SymPy is a general library. Supporting every possible model or expression is not a
finite feature list. These are concrete capabilities **not yet supported as complete
physics requests**; the presence of SymPy or a related named formula is not coverage:

- ODE initial/boundary conditions, coupled ODEs, PDEs and user-specified piecewise models.
- Lagrange/Kane/Hamilton derivations from bodies, generalized coordinates and constraints.
- Laplace/Fourier transforms, transfer functions, state-space and stability analysis.
- Quantum operators/states, commutators, spin, wavefunction normalization and expectation
  values as typed physics operations; explicit finite integrals and matrices can express
  some of their mathematics, but do not supply their physics assumptions.
- Polarization/Jones matrices, paraxial ray systems and symbolic beam/continuum mechanics.
- Tensor relativity, symbolic Maxwell systems and coordinate systems beyond Cartesian.
- Automatic unit checking of arbitrary symbolic models, positivity/reality assumptions,
  transcendental solution sets, singular parameter branches and numerical root searches.
- Parameter sliders with server recomputation, additional field/circuit/wave scenes, and
  device profiling of frame time, clipping, accessibility and background transitions.

These require explicit contracts and testable physical assumptions. Unsupported requests
must continue to decline instead of returning a fragment under a verified label.

## Native animation contract

The native renderer uses Skia with Reanimated shared/derived values. The server samples
the path uniformly in time; the device interpolates those samples with a uniform spatial
scale. Physics is never re-solved on the device. Timing metadata must record the physical
time span and playback rate separately, and scene replacement must cancel the old clock.
An incline whose length is only a display choice omits physical duration; its
accelerating illustration remains playable without an invented time caption.
Reduce Motion keeps the static diagram. Lifecycle and parameter tests complement native
device validation; Jest mocks cannot establish native frame rate or visual quality.

## Reported exercise and diagram flow

The literal request `Do one 10th grde physics problem` previously reached a provider
that offered a diagram, then returned broken Mermaid and ASCII art after `Okay diagram`.
The request now selects a complete, verified horizontal-launch exercise. Adjacent
diagram requests and visual-offer acceptances recover one problem statement and solve
it again. They discard old answers and scene payloads, stop at unrelated exchanges,
and preserve a new image as the current source. Unsupported diagrams and animations
decline before the provider can invent a replacement. Final physics output removes
model-authored visual fences and drawing promises, including the unverified path.

The live API check exercised the exact request, `Okay diagram`, and an animation
request, then checked the saved replies. Each supported reply contained one native
scene. A heat problem followed by an animation request returned and saved the native
animation-unavailable response. The verified replies bypassed the model provider;
tests cover model-authored offers and unsupported drawing cleanup separately.

All eight native scene types were inspected in the iOS Simulator with actual server
payloads: projectile, orbit, collision, incline, harmonic motion, lever, free-body,
and vectors. Falling-body and reversing SUVAT scenes were checked as well. Collision
mass labels alternate above and below the bodies, with title space reserved for the
upper label. Automated contracts cover parsing/rendering all types and Reduce Motion;
lifecycle tests cover replacement, cancellation and background resume. Native frame
time and accessibility profiling remain outstanding.
