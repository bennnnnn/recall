"""Strict-typing ratchet for the packages that decide replies (docs/STRUCTURE_TICKETS.md ST-02).

`uv run mypy` checks these packages loosely. This runs `mypy --strict` over each one not yet in
the strict overrides of apps/api/pyproject.toml and holds its error count file by file in
scripts/mypy_strict_baseline.json: a new error fails with its file:line, and a file with fewer
errors than recorded fails until the baseline is lowered, so the count only falls. A package
that reaches none fails until it joins the strict overrides, where `uv run mypy` holds it.

A suppression is no fix: each `# type: ignore` in a ratcheted package counts as one error of its
file, and a whole-file escape (`# mypy:` inline settings, a `# type: ignore` on a line of its own,
an `ignore_errors` or `disable_error_code` override in pyproject.toml) fails outright in any reply
package. A renamed or split file is new to the baseline: --update records it while its package's
total does not grow.

Usage (from apps/api, in its virtualenv):
  uv run python ../../scripts/check_mypy_strict.py            check
  uv run python ../../scripts/check_mypy_strict.py --update   after a fix: lower the recorded
                                                              counts (never raises or adds one)
