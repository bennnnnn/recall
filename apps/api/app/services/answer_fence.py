"""The answer-card protocol: which ```answer fence the server vouches for.

The phone draws the green check on an ```answer fence only when the fence body
opens with ``verified: true`` (the same header-line style as
``notation: chemistry``). Only the server writes that line, and only on a card
whose value came from a solver: the post-stream fence pass appends it to the
cards it writes, and an instant reply (wholly server text) gets it on every
card. Model text never keeps it:

1. ``strip_forged_verified_markers`` removes the line from the model's reply
   before any server card is added, so the model cannot forge a check.
2. ``normalize_owned_fences`` rewrites every spelling of a model answer fence
   (indented in a list, ``~~~answer``, four backticks, ``` answer``, capital
   ``Answer``, ``result`` / ``final``) to the plain column-0 form, so each
   subject's fence pass sees and demotes all of them, not only ``\\n```answer``.
3. ``strip_verification_claims`` drops the model's own "✅ Verified with SymPy",
   and ``strip_model_simulation_fences`` its own ```simulation scene.

The server writes the line with ``verified_answer_fence`` (post-stream cards)
and ``mark_server_answer_fences`` (an instant reply, once, when it is sent).
``land_answer_card`` puts a reply's final answer in one card under one
**Answer** heading: the verified card, or the model's own final line in a card
with no marker. The fence scan is a linear line scan, no nested regex on untrusted text.
