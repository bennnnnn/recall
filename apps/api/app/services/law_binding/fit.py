"""Fill one catalog law from a question's stated values and words.

A subject's binder finds the laws whose ``Binding`` names what a question asks, then asks
this module to fill each one:

- every stated value fills one input of its dimension. Two inputs of one
  dimension are told apart by the word just before the value ("from", "to",
  "initial", "reaches") or just after it ("on the primary"), or filled in
  order (largest first where the law says so);
- a value the words mark as the result itself ("reaches 18 m/s" when the
  final speed is asked) means this is not the law;
- unstated inputs come from phrases ("from rest" is u = 0) or from the subject's
  settings (g, the named planet's mass);
- the filled inputs must be exactly a set the solver answers from.

Anything short of one way to fill the law declines: a value has no input, or an input
could take either of two values.
