r"""One layout for a worked answer in parts, whoever worked it.

A question in parts reads as a single worked answer does, once:

- **Given**: one section for the whole question, never one under a part. A given every
  part shares is a line of its own; a given only some parts use carries their letters as
  Required's lines do (``(a) $t = 1\,\mathrm{s}$``). One ``where`` line names every symbol
  once.
- **Required**: one line per part, ``(a) $v$ (speed after 1 s)``
- **Solution**, then each part: its label (``**(a) Speed after 1 s**``), its formula
  under its name's heading, its substitution or steps, and **Answer (a)** with that part's
  card; a hairline between parts

Physics' own parts (``modules/physics/direct.py``), the separate questions of one message
solved one by one (``services/subjects/dispatch.py``) and the model-written ```worked
block in parts (``modules/chat/worked_render.py``) all render here. Before November 2026
the separate questions came back as whole replies one after another: the givens repeated
under each part, the part above its givens, and no card under any answer (the finalize
pass for one verified part dropped the others'). Until 2026-11-02 a given one part used
was listed under a second **Given** inside that part.
