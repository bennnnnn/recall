"""One "Answer" label per answer, for every subject's reply a model wrote.

A follow-up copied its history and wrote **Answer**, then ``Answer: 26.3\\,\\mathrm{N·m}``
(the value as raw LaTeX), and the card under it drew a third label. Before a subject
lands its card (``land_answer_card``), this leaves one label:

- ``**Answer**`` and, under it, ``Answer: X``: the heading over ``X``, LaTeX as maths;
- in a worked one-part reply (Find, Formula, Substitution or Steps, or a card), only
  the last label: earlier bare headings go, and an earlier ``Answer: X`` keeps only its
  value, as working. A quiz's "**Answer:** 4" under each question is left alone;
- a reply in parts keeps one label per part (``**Answer (a)**``).

Code fences are left alone.
