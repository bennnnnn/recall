"""Pure text-scanning primitives with no subject semantics.

Neither of these knows what a "kind" is or what a solver does — they answer
"is this phrase glued inside a longer word" and "does this look like an
equals-sign equation," nothing more. Math's extractor layer and physics's
extractor layer both lean on them heavily, so they live here rather than in
`app.modules.math`, which used to make physics import through math just to
reach a string scanner. See docs/SUBJECT_SEPARATION_TICKETS.md (S4).
