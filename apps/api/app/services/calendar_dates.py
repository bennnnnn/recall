"""Dates the user names: month names, ISO dates and (where a caller asks) slash dates.

The reminder reader, recurring pay and the calendar facts each kept a month table and
a date grammar of their own: "2027-1-7" was a date to recurring pay and not to the
calendar facts, "12/25" only to recurring pay, and "remind me on 2026-12-25" named no
day to the reminder reader (code-health audit DUP-09). This reads the dates; each
caller keeps its own decisions (which year is meant, whether a past date counts, a
lowercase "may" that may be a verb).
