"""One worked-solution layout for every subject.

A worked reply has the same sections everywhere, in this order, each only when
it has lines:

- **Given**: the problem as the student wrote it, or the stated values, closed by a
  ``where`` line naming their symbols (``where_line``)
- **Required**: what is asked (**Find** before November 2026; a reader takes both)
- **Formula**: the law or rule that governs it; a physics law is headed by its own
  name instead (**Constant acceleration**, ``modules/physics/law_titles.py``). A
  rearrangement for the unknown is a line of its own, ``Solve for $t$``
  (``solve_for_line``), then the rearranged formula
- **Substitution**: values put into that formula
- **Steps**: an equation changed one move at a time
- **Answer**: the verified result (the caller's answer fence follows)

Each line is one state. A move is a short note after the state
(``$2x = 8$ — subtract 3 from both sides``), never a heading of its own.
Maths numbers each move instead (``modules/math/tools/lesson.py``): a bold
``**1. Subtract 4 from both sides**`` over the move written on both sides,
then the simplified line.
Lines in a section are hard line breaks, so the section reads as one block
and every client keeps the breaks.
