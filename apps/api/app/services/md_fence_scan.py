"""Markdown code fences: the one grammar every reader of a reply uses.

Three grammars and about nineteen ad-hoc readers disagreed (code-health audit DUP-03).
Backtick-only readers let any run of backticks close any fence, and the closer that
runs on every saved reply counted fence lines by parity, so a how-to showing a
```` ``` ```` line inside a ``~~~`` block got a stray fence appended. This reads fences
as CommonMark does: ``` or ~~~, a closer of the opener's character at least as long,
a fence line inside another fence is only its content. ``lenient`` (model text, the
default for the scans) also takes deeper indents and ``>`` quote markers; the region
rewriter reads strictly, as the phone's twin does. Linear: no nested regex runs on
untrusted assistant text.
