"""Guard a scan read-back: per-user limits, payload limits, the vision spend cap.

Math, physics and chemistry each read a cropped photo back for the student to
confirm. They run the same checks before their reader and record the same
spend after it, so a subject adds a reader here, not a copy of the guard.
Every read also shares one deadline (``scan_read_deadline_seconds``), which
the reader spreads over its own steps.

The per-user checks (reads open at once, the hourly rate, the day's chat
tokens) run before the body is read: a photo is megabytes in memory, and
several at once from one account pushed a machine toward its memory limit.
A read has no daily count of its own: it takes ``scan_read_tokens`` from the
chat's daily allowance, and once that is spent it is refused as a chat turn is
(``quota_exceeded``).
