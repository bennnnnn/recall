"""Verified calculus applications: area between curves, arc length, volume.

These are the shapes `extract_math_intent` refused outright after an area
question was answered with the *intersection points* of its two curves. The
refusal was the right stopgap; this replaces it with real answers, and keeps a
refusal for every case SymPy cannot close.

The rule throughout: a verified block tells the model not to recompute, so an
unevaluated integral, a non-finite result, or a region whose sign we cannot
establish is refused rather than approximated.
