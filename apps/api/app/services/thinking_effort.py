"""How hard a turn should think: off, hard, or escalate.

Thinking costs time and output tokens, so an ordinary question gets none. A
genuinely hard question gets the cheapest level that thinks (``message_needs
_thinking``). One level more only when the user pushes back on the answer
before ("that's wrong", "try again", "that's not what I asked") or regenerates it. The
catalog turns each level into a value the model supports.
