"""The subjects a turn is solved by, each plugged in through one adapter (structure ticket ST-07).

A subject (maths, physics, chemistry) owns one ``SubjectAdapter`` in its public ``subject``
file, and ``SUBJECTS`` below names it in one entry, as ``services/mcp`` registers the model's
tools. The dispatcher (``services/subjects/dispatch``) asks a subject through its adapter, never
through the subject's own files. Which subject a line is belongs to the subject order
(``services/subjects/order``), the one place precedence between subjects is written: the order
of ``SUBJECTS`` decides nothing.

An adapter has what the dispatcher and chat ask of every subject:

- ``name``: the subject, one of ``SubjectName``;
- ``solve``: the turn's verified block for a line, the prompt note when nothing verified it,
  and whether the subject tried and declined (``SubjectAugmentation``);
- ``direct_reply``: the reply a verified block may show without a model, or None. It runs in
  the SymPy pool (its checks parse with SymPy);
- ``hints``: its prompt copy, and where chat states it (``SubjectHints``);
- ``asks``: whether a line asks something of the subject (its cue), solved or not;
- ``reads``: whether the subject reads a request out of the line (its intent);
- ``fast_lane``: the model lane its own read of a line suggests to Auto routing;
- ``instant_reply``: a reply the subject writes for a line with no model and no solve;
- ``warm``: what a fresh SymPy pool worker runs first, so a turn pays no imports;
- ``solve_timeouts``: the solves of the subject that ran out of time inside a block;
- ``photo``: how it reads its problem off a turn's photo (``SubjectPhoto``), or None;
- ``tool``: how the tool loop checks calls to the model tool it owns (``SubjectTool``), or
  None;
- ``followups``: how it reads a line that goes back to its last problem
  (``SubjectFollowups``);
- ``fence``: how it holds a finished reply's fences to its verified block, and the notes,
  drawings and clean-up it adds (``SubjectFence``).

A subject with nothing to offer for a member answers None or False, or returns the text as it is.

Money is registered beside them as a peer (``MONEY``, a ``MoneyPeer``): a loan, card or
savings question is worked before the prompt and gets its calculator card after the reply,
and a money turn has no subject solve (chat's ``turn_prep``).

A new subject is a module with its own ``subject`` adapter, its name in ``SubjectName`` (in
``services/solving``, beside the verified block every subject's solve names itself in) and its
entry in ``SUBJECTS``; ``tests/services/test_subject_registry.py`` holds the two to each other.
