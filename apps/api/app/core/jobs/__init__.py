"""Durable background jobs on a Redis Stream.

Title generation, memory extraction, and history compression are enqueued to a
Redis Stream and processed by a consumer in the worker process (``worker_main``).
Because the stream is persisted in Redis, jobs survive a process restart, and a
crash mid-processing leaves the entry in the consumer group's pending list —
reclaimed via XAUTOCLAIM by a live worker. At-least-once. The worker trims only
entries that were delivered and acked; the stream's hard ceiling
(``jobs_stream_max_len``) drops the oldest only when no worker reads for long,
and the queue metrics warn before that.

``queue`` registers handlers, enqueues and bounds the stream, ``dedupe`` keeps
a logical job from running twice, ``delayed`` holds retries and entries of a type
this worker cannot run yet (``outcomes`` decides which), ``worker`` consumes, ``inflight`` runs the held entries
under the concurrency limits and leases them, ``pending`` handles trimmed and
poison entries, and ``admin`` holds queue metrics, the DLQ (with an hourly replay of
types safe to run twice) and the per-user purge. Every submodule logs as
``app.core.jobs``.
