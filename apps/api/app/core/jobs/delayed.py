"""Jobs that wait: a retry, or an entry for a type this worker does not know yet.

A failed job used to retry in-process twice within about six seconds and then
go to the dead-letter queue, so a 30-second embedding or email outage lost
every job that started in it. Now each failure puts the entry back with
``attempt`` + 1 into a sorted set scored by when it may run, and the worker
loop moves due entries onto the stream. Six attempts span about 50 minutes,
long enough to outlast a provider blip, before the job is dead-lettered. The
slot is free while the job waits.
