"""Await several coroutines as one: if any fails, the rest are cancelled.

``asyncio.gather`` leaves the siblings of a failed branch running: a paid model
call, a search or a download keeps going after its turn already failed, and its
own error is never retrieved. Code that wants every branch to finish whatever the
others do passes ``return_exceptions=True`` to ``asyncio.gather`` and handles each
result (``app/tests/architecture/test_gather_cancels.py``).
