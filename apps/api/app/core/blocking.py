"""Bounded thread pools for blocking calls, one per kind of call; never the default executor.

``asyncio.to_thread`` runs on the loop's default executor: ``min(32, cpus + 4)`` threads,
five on a one-CPU machine, shared by every caller. R2 calls with their retries,
thumbnail resizes, Google sign-in and a stalled DuckDuckGo search queued behind one
another, and a wait that timed out left its thread running (code-health audit LEAK-02).
Each kind gets its own small pool, so one kind filling up delays only itself.
