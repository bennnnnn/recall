"""Bounded executor for SymPy work — isolates CPU-bound math in subprocesses
with a hard kill on timeout.

SymPy's ``solve``/``integrate``/``simplify`` are synchronous, CPU-bound, and
unbounded in runtime on pathological inputs. ``asyncio.to_thread`` on the
shared default thread pool:

1. Shares that pool with every other ``to_thread`` caller — a hung SymPy call
   starves unrelated async work.
2. Cannot be hard-killed: cancelling the await leaves the underlying thread
   running the bad SymPy call until it finishes (or forever), leaking the
   thread and its CPU.

This module provides dedicated, bounded ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` slots so SymPy work is
isolated and a runaway can be SIGTERM'd without killing siblings. Tests inject a
thread-based variant (a subprocess can't see test-local patches). How a worker starts
(``spawn``), runs a job and is reaped is ``sympy_worker_process``.
