"""Readings: pure reads of a message, done off the event loop and kept for the turn.

Subject detection and the maths, physics and chemistry readers are pure functions of
the text, CPU-bound, and unbounded on a hostile message: maths parses with SymPy, and
physics and chemistry run hundreds of patterns. On the event loop one such message
stalled every request on the machine for minutes (code-health audit SCALE-01).

A function marked ``@reading`` keeps its result for the current turn.
``await read_off_loop(fn, ...)`` runs ``fn`` in the killable SymPy pool, records every
reading made there, and the turn replays them, so the sync callers deep in prompt
building get their answer without reading on the loop. A pool read that times out
declines the turn's readings: each then returns its ``declined`` value (no subject, no
intent), and the model answers without a verified solve.

Inside a turn whose message was read, a reading that was not (another text, another
argument) is computed on the event loop: it still runs, and logs, and the test suite
fails on it (``app/tests/loop_guard.py``, which also fails on SymPy run on the loop).
