"""This process's copies of recently loaded users, checked against a generation in Redis.

Every authenticated request and every chat turn needs the user row, and Neon is a
round trip or more away, so the last loaded row stays here. Each request reads the
user's current generation in the same MGET as its token check
(``core/access_tokens.check_access``), and a copy is used only under the generation
it was loaded at.

Whoever commits a write to a user row awaits ``publish_change`` right after, which
stores a new generation: ``users_repo.update`` does for its own commits, a caller
that commits itself does after its commit, and so does the history scan's stamp.
So a plan change from the RevenueCat webhook, a settings, memory or preferences
change, or consent saved on any machine applies to the next request and the next
chat turn on every machine. ``memory_edited_at`` is read only from the row itself
(background jobs), so a hand edit's stamp does not publish.

A publish Redis refuses (after retries) fails the request with 503, though its
write is saved: while Redis is down every request is refused anyway, and the
write's retry (the client's, RevenueCat's redelivery, a job's) publishes again.
Until then, once Redis is back, a copy can lag that write by at most the TTL.
