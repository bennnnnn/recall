"""Which SymPy worker slot a job may take: solves cannot fill the slot readings keep.

Every turn reads its message in the SymPy pool (``core/readings.py``, a few
milliseconds), beside real solves that may run for seconds. With one shared queue,
slow solves on every slot made each turn on the machine wait out the slot wait and
then route without its subject reading. Now solves hold at most ``slots -
reserved_for_readings`` slots at once; a reading may take any free slot, and a slot
that frees goes to a waiting reading before a waiting solve. Readings never wait
behind solves for the reserved slot, and use the solve slots when those are idle.
