"""Slow solves cannot starve a turn's message reading of a SymPy slot.

Every turn reads its message in the pool; it shared the three slots with real solves,
so three slow solves made every turn on the machine wait the 2 s slot wait and then
route without its subject reading. These run on the executor's in-process path (no
worker processes), which takes slots exactly as the process pool does.
