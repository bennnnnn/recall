"""Direct callers of the readers behind a turn's decisions are listed, with why (ST-05).

These tests police who calls a reader, not how often a turn reads it. A call is found
through the file's own imports: a bare name bound by ``from <module> import name`` (aliases
too) or defined in the module itself, and ``alias.name`` where ``alias`` is the module.

Small talk is decided once per turn, in its place, by ``turn_prep.mode.classify_turn_mode``
(``_TurnMode.lightweight`` and its reason, carried as ``ctx.lightweight_turn``): a short
reply to an offer or a clarify card is an answer, not a greeting. Calling the reader on the
turn's message again elsewhere decides it a second time, without that place.

Whether the message asks to be taught is the turn's reading (``TurnReading.teaching``, read
by ``read_turn``); code asks ``turn_reading.turn.teaching_of``, which answers from the
reading for the turn's message and reads any other text on its own.

The message's subject is read in the pool and kept on the reading (``TurnReading.subject``
and the step of the subject order that decided it); chat code asks
``chat.turn_prep.reading.subject_of``, which answers from the reading for the turn's
message read with the turn's flags and reads anything else as before.

Every other caller reads some other text, or composes the reader into a reader of its own;
each function is listed with how many times it calls and why, and the lists only shrink.
