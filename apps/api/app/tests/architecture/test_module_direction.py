"""Modules depend one way; every import that runs upward is named (code-health audit ARCH-11).

The cycle test reads files at load time, so a cycle between modules hid behind imports
in functions, and nothing said which way modules may depend. Here every import that can
run counts, inside a function too (one under ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` does not), collapsed
to the components it joins (``modules.<name>``, ``services.<name>``), in four layers:

0. the shared leaves in ``services/``;
1. the subjects: maths, physics, chemistry;
2. the product features, and the subject dispatcher;
3. chat, which runs a turn over all of them.

A component imports its own layer or a lower one. An import that runs upward is listed
below with why it stays; the list only shrinks, and without it the graph has no cycle.
