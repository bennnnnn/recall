"""Code fences are read with one grammar (``services/md_fence_scan.py``), not by hand.

Three grammars and about nineteen ad-hoc readers disagreed: backtick-only checks let
any run close any fence, a regex closed a fence on the first ``` anywhere, and line
loops toggled a flag on every ``` line, so a ``` shown inside a ~~~ block turned the
rest of the reply inside out (code-health audit DUP-03). A reader of a reply reads
markers with ``read_fence_marker`` or walks ``iter_fences`` / ``line_fences``; this
fails on a fence tested with ``startswith``, located with ``find`` or matched with a
regex anywhere else.
