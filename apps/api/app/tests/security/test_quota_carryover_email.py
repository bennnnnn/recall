"""A deleted account's limits carry to the next account on the same email address.

Account delete kept the day's counters only under the sign-in identity
(``quota_carryover``). Delete an Apple account on x@icloud.com, sign in with Google on the
same address, and the new account started from zero: its snapshot was filed under the
Apple id. The snapshot is now also kept under a one-way code of the address (trimmed and
lower-cased) when one of the deleted account's sign-in providers owns the address (only
then: ``test_quota_carryover_email_owner.py``), and every new account or new link on that
address starts from it. Each counter ends at the larger value, never summed.

Real Postgres and the configured Redis (``real_redis``), through the HTTP sign-in and
delete routes.
