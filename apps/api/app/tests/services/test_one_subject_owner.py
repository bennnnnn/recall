"""One owner decides which STEM subject a line is (code-health audit DUP-05).

Presentation, routing, related questions and the maths follow-up gate each asked their
own gates in their own order: "h = 20t - 5t^2, find the maximum height" was solved by
maths and prompted with physics' pack, and a balanced equation went to the maths lane.
Each now asks ``detect_subject``; this holds them to it across every corpus.
