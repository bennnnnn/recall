"""P13: motion under constant acceleration.

The largest coverage gap round 1 left, and the most common school physics topic
there is. `kinematics` solves free fall *under gravity*, so a car pulling away
from a stop was not physics to us at all — all six probed phrasings returned
nothing.

Two things shaped the implementation. The op names the **unknown** and the
solver picks whichever of the four equations the givens support, so one set of
phrasing rules covers all four rather than four sets — the approach P8 used for
Ohm's law. And the extractor runs *after* kinematics rather than before: free
fall is a constant acceleration too, and kinematics already owns it, so
inheriting only what gravity did not claim perturbs nothing that already
answered.
