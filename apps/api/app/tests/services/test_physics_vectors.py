"""P17: vector forces — resultants and components.

Everything else on the `force` kind is scalar, which is why "a 3 N force east
and a 4 N force north" had no answer at all.

The ticket asked which extractor should own this, since `services/math/` already
has a `vector` kind for magnitude/dot/cross. It cannot: that one matches literal
angle-bracket operands ("magnitude of <3, 4>") through
`is_closed_coordinate_vector_request`, and a force question names units and
compass directions instead. The two never see the same sentence. This is a
physics extractor and the maths one is untouched — asserted below rather than
asserted in a PR description.
