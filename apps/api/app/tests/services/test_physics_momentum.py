"""P4: momentum, impulse and 1D collisions.

The first ticket that adds verified physics surface rather than repairing it.
Momentum was the highest-frequency of the twelve topics the review found with
no verified answer under any phrasing — `p = mv`, `J = FΔt` and 1D
conservation are the most common mechanics asks after kinematics.

The negative table matters as much as the positive one. Physics extractors run
before the generic equation extractor, and this one runs before force and
energy, so an over-broad cue here steals from three directions at once.
