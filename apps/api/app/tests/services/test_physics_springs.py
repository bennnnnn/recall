"""P7: springs, Hooke's law and simple harmonic motion.

Two hazards shaped this one.

"spring" is a season and a semester, so it is never a cue on its own — it only
counts beside a spring constant. And `k = 200` reads as an equation: before this
extractor existed, `what is the period of simple harmonic motion for a 0.5 kg
mass and k = 200 N/m` was answered as algebra, with `N = km/200`. The constant
is stripped before the equation check for exactly that reason.

The SHM period also emits a `position_vs_time` trajectory, which is what P3's
player animates — an oscillation is the one verified result where the motion is
the whole point.
