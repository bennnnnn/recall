"""One layout for every worked answer in parts (``services/worked_parts``).

"A ball is dropped from 20 m. What's its speed after 1 s? How long to reach the ground?"
came back as two whole replies: the givens under each part, the part above its givens and
no card under either answer (2026-11-01). It now reads Given and Required once, then
Solution and each part closed by its own card, and the cards reach the saved reply.
