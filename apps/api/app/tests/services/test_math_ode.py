"""Linear ODEs, and the guard that stops algebra inventing an answer for one.

``solve y'' + y = 0`` used to reach the algebra extractor, which dropped the
``y''`` term, solved the remnant ``+ y = 0``, and published a *verified*
``y = 0``. The prompt tells the model to use verified numbers and not
recompute, so a wrong answer arrived with full confidence — the worst result
this pipeline can produce.
