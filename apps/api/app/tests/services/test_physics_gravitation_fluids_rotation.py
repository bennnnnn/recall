"""Round 3: gravitation, fluids and rotation.

Three things here were not formula work at all, and each was a wrong answer
waiting rather than a gap:

1. **Scientific notation did not parse.** "a planet of mass 6e24 kg" matched as
   *24 kg*, and the surface gravity came out 0.00 m/s^2. Astronomy is written
   this way and nothing else in the package reads it, so the fix is in the
   shared value scanners, not here.
2. **An altitude is not in the same unit as a radius.** "400 km above the
   earth" was added to 6.371e6 m as the number 400, giving the surface orbital
   speed to four significant figures — a plausible wrong answer. The two now
   travel as separate params and are added after the unit conversion.
3. **"two 1000 kg masses" states one number for two bodies**, which is the
   commonest wording of Newton's law of gravitation.

Rotation reverses nothing: P9's `_TORQUE_UNSUPPORTED` refusal stays exactly as
it was, because that is what stops *torque* claiming a moment of inertia. This
extractor runs after it and picks up the fall-through.
