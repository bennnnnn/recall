"""P14: the `simulation` fence — a scene, not a plot of one.

P3 animated the trajectory *graph*, which shows the shape of a path. Seven of
the eleven verified kinds draw nothing at all, and for several the picture is
the explanation: circular motion is the most natural animation in the subject
and had no visual whatsoever.

`GraphBlockSpec` cannot express a scene. It is an x-y plot with axes and one
curve; a scene needs bodies with sizes, a ground, and force vectors pointing
somewhere in the world rather than along an axis.

This is the first slice the ticket asked for — the spec plus projectile and
orbit. Collisions are the next one, and the spec already carries what they
need (several bodies on one clock), which is asserted here so the shape cannot
drift before they land.
