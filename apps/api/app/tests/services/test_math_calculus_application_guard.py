"""The funnel guard for region questions the solvers decline.

History matters here, because this file has now been right twice for different
reasons.

"Area between y=x and y=x^2 from 0 to 1" was once answered
`x = 0, y = 0; x = 1, y = 1` — where the curves *cross*. The area is 1/6. The
simultaneous-equation extractor had claimed it and ignored both "area between"
and the bounds. #1344 refused every region question outright, and this file
asserted those refusals.

Those questions are answered properly now (see
`test_math_calculus_applications.py`), so the refusals moved rather than
vanished: the guard runs *after* the application extractors instead of before
them. What they claim is let through; what they decline is still refused.

That ordering is the whole point, and narrowing the guard to only the
unimplemented wordings reopened the original bug within minutes — "area between
y=x and y=x^2" with no stated interval is declined for a missing given, fell
through to the algebra side, and answered with the intersection points again.
Declining means a given is missing, not that another reading is available.
