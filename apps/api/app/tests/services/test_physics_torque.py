"""P9: torque and rotational equilibrium.

`"moment"` is ordinary English — *"give me a moment"*, *"at the moment"* — so it
is never a cue on its own; it qualifies only beside a pivot word.

The balance case needed more than cue care. Reading the two forces and the one
distance in *written order* looks right and is not: in "the distance for a 10 N
force to balance a 5 N force at 2 m", the 10 N is mentioned first but the 2 m is
the **5 N force's** arm. Written order answers 4 m; the true answer is 1 m. The
distance is paired with the force that precedes it instead, and the force left
without an arm is the unknown.
