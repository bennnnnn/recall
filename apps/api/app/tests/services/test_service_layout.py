"""Structural guard: a domain lives in one package, not a package plus siblings.

Every split this repo has had started the same way — a domain got a package,
then the next module landed next to it as `services/<domain>_<thing>.py`
because that was one line cheaper than moving in. Math reached three sibling
packages and six loose files that way; chemistry, learning and notifications
each grew a second copy of themselves as compatibility aliases.

These tests fail on the first module that starts it again.
