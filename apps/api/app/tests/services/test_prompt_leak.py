"""Prompt scaffolding must never survive into a user-visible reply.

`[BEGIN VERIFIED MATH]` / `[END VERIFIED MATH]` wrap the block injected into
the prompt on every verified math turn. The model is instructed never to
mention a system block — but instruction is not enforcement, and this class of
leak has already reached a user once: `*Couldn't verify this with SymPy.*`
appeared under an anatomy answer (fixed separately).

Every other test touching these markers asserts they are *present in the
prompt*. These assert they are absent from what the user sees.
