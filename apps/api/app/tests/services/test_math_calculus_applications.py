"""Area between curves, arc length, volume of revolution, and even/odd.

This replaces the blanket refusal added in #1344, which was itself a response to
"area between y=x and y=x^2 from 0 to 1" being answered with the *intersection
points* of its two curves. The refusal stopped the wrong answer; this answers
the question.

Two things here are worth more than the formulas.

**Signed cancellation.** The area between sin(x) and 0 over a full period is 4,
not 0. Integrating the signed difference would let the half below the axis
cancel the half above it, and the answer would be exactly zero — a number that
looks like a result. The integral is split at every crossing instead.

**Partial bound matches.** "from 0 to 2*pi" originally matched just the `2`,
silently answering on [0, 2]. That is the same failure the whole refusal existed
to prevent, reintroduced through the bounds rather than the curves, so the bound
pattern is ordered longest-first and closed with a lookahead.
