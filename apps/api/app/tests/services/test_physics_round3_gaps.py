"""Round 3: the quantities the existing kinds could not answer.

Nothing here was a wrong answer — all fourteen phrasings returned nothing at
all — so this file is about reach rather than correctness. Each one is a
one-line formula the kind already had every given for:

    circular   omega = v / r            had v and r, computed neither
    spring     f = 1/T, v_max = A omega had neither a k nor an L to hang on
    friction   mu = tan(theta), F = mu m g

Two of them needed a cue as well as an op, which is the part that is easy to
miss: "the angular velocity of a car going 10 m/s around a 20 m radius track"
fired no circular cue at all, so a new op alone would have changed nothing.
