"""A deploy must not be an outage that cuts replies.

fly.toml had no kill_timeout (Fly stops a Machine 5s after its signal) and
uvicorn had no --timeout-graceful-shutdown, and the single app Machine was
replaced with the rolling default, which stops it before its replacement is
healthy. Chat turns stop-and-save inside the 30s grace window, which these
numbers promise.
