"""Homework is its subject's question before it is one about the user's place: "A ball is
dropped from a height of 20 m. How long does it take to reach the ground?" was answered "I
don't have your location yet" (2026-11-01). The turn's reading, read in the pool, names the
message's subject; every reader of the user's place defers to it, solved or not
(``web_search.weather.is_worked_problem``), unless the line says it is about where the user
is ("near me", "here", "in my area", "from my location").
