"""A line that changes the chat's last money request's term or rate, and every line that
changes something else, which goes to the model.

Live (2026-10-25): "hmm what if i only do 3 years instead" after a used-car loan got no
card, and the model's own arithmetic was off by dollars. Four reviews of wider readers
(same day) each found a new shape they misread as a price, a down payment, a payment, a
kind or a term: "it's 40k miles", "what if I pay 400 instead?", "what about a 2019
model?", "what if my payment is 3%", "it's been 5 years", "what's 7%?". The server now
works a new term or rate only, asked for in a change frame ("what if", "what about",
"and", ... or "... instead") and read by a positive grammar (``change_line``).
