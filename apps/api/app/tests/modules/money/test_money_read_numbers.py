"""Numbers read whole: a decimal-comma rate, a term in words with hundreds, time already spent.

A retrospective review of the money reader (2026-11-01) found three ways a believable wrong
number reached a worked answer: "3,5%" read as 5% (a €1,052 payment for €901), "one hundred
twenty months" read as 20 months, and "I've been paying my mortgage at 4% for five years"
read as a 5-year term. Each number is now read whole, or the reader gives it no value.
