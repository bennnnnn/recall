"""What each number in a money request is: the term, the compounding, the loan.

From the Ethiopian grade 11 and 12 books (2026-10-31) and the review of their fix: a term in
words, "compounded quarterly", a price with a deposit; and the look-alikes that must not
change (an age or time gone by is no term, two prices compared name no loan, an exchange
rate or a note is no sum, a sum owed is the loan as it stands).
