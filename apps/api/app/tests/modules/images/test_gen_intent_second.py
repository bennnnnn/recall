"""A draw-me line with a second request is declined exactly where the plan cuts it.

``asks_separately`` keeps "draw me a cat and also explain black holes" from drawing the
whole line: the plan draws the cat and answers the rest. It reads the plan's own cut
(``chat.cuts_after_picture``). A line it declines that the plan keeps whole draws nothing
at all (main drew it: "draw me a dog and tell me about dog breeds"); a line the plan cuts
that it lets through draws the whole line, question and all. Review 6 found 191 of 696
fuzzed lines drawn whole where the plan cut ("… and suggest names", ". Also …"), because
the old rule knew only nine answer verbs; the fuzz here is built from every opener the
plan cuts at.
