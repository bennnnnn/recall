"""Scene v2: the pictures a solved question carries, and the diagrams the phone lays out.

Every picture here comes from a real question through the real extractor and
solver, so a test fails when a question stops drawing, draws the wrong
apparatus (a concave mirror as a lens, a roller coaster as a straight drop),
