"""Round 3: the last three kinds.

Two collisions shaped this one, and neither is about physics:

- **"modulus" belongs to complex numbers first.** `SCHOOL_EXTRACTORS` run
  before `PHYSICS_EXTRACTORS`, so "the young modulus for a stress of 2e7 Pa"
  was read as |z| and failed as an unparseable expression. The elastic moduli
  are named explicitly there rather than left to ordering.
- **stress and pressure are the same arithmetic.** sigma = F/A and P = F/A
  differ by one word and nothing else, so `materials` runs before `fluids` and
  the two cue sets are kept disjoint by vocabulary. The pair of tests at the
  bottom is the only thing holding that line.

"half life" is ordinary English — a meme has one — so it is a co-occurrence cue
rather than a substring. The decoy table caught that directly.
