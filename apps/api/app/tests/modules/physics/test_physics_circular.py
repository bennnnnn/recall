"""P6: circular motion — centripetal force, acceleration and orbital period.

The whole risk in this ticket is the vocabulary. "circle", "radius" and
"period" all belong to subjects Recall already verifies — circle geometry and
trigonometry — and the geometry extractors run *after* physics, so any of them
used as a cue would have taken those questions rather than competed for them.
Only words that mean *motion* qualify, and "period" counts solely beside a
radius.
