"""Round 3: the projectile ops that are not about distance.

Three wrong answers reached users here, all one defect. The op was an
*initializer* — ``op: Literal["range", "max_height"] = "range"`` — so any
projectile question that did not say "height" was answered with the horizontal
range: "what is the time of flight" came back ``35.31 m``.

Two neighbours turned out to be the same defect wearing different hats, and are
fixed here too. ``kinematics`` runs before ``projectile`` and claimed
"launched at 20 m/s at 30 degrees, how long until it hits the ground", where it
has no angle to apply and used the whole 20 m/s as the vertical component:
``4.08 s`` against the true ``2.04 s``. And P11's collision guard matched
``\bhits?\b``, so "how fast does it hit the ground" read as a two-body
collision and got no answer at all.

The fix is the shape SUVAT already uses (``_SUVAT_UNKNOWN_RES``): a phrasing ->
op table, and a question the table does not recognise is refused rather than
answered with whatever came first.
