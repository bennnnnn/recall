"""P16: tension and Atwood machines.

The one topic round 1 **refused on purpose**. P2 found "the tension supporting a
5 kg mass accelerating at 2 m/s^2" answered `10 N` — m*a — when the answer is
T = m(g + a) = 59.05 N, and put `tension` and `pulley` into
`_UNSUPPORTED_FORCE_CONTEXT` rather than let a confidently wrong number ship.
The refusal was right; the gap is that it was never filled.

Both sides are kept. P5's correction said the refusal tuple guards the
fall-through and its entries are not deleted wholesale when a topic lands, so
this extractor runs *ahead* of force and claims only the two shapes it can
solve. A rope at an angle, a rope across a table, two ropes sharing a load —
each still reaches the refusal, because each would be answered confidently and
wrongly by T = m(g ± a).
