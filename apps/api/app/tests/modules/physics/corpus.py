"""Physics QA corpus: school questions with independently computed answers.

Every expected value here was worked by hand from the textbook formula, with
g = 9.81 m/s² and CODATA constants, not read back from the solver. The test
in ``test_physics_corpus.py`` holds two lines:

* a verified answer is never wrong: a solve either matches or declines;
* coverage only goes up: ``COVERAGE_FLOOR`` counts the cases answered today.

Add a row whenever a phrasing is fixed or found wrong. ``None`` marks a
question that must decline because any single answer to it would mislead.
