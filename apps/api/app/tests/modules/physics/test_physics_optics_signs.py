"""Optics certifies only the signs it read (retro review, 2026-11-01).

- A myopic eye's lens, a minus lens, a rear-view mirror and an upright, diminished image
  are diverging elements, however the question words them.
- m = -v/u and the image distance read every distance as a real one: a sign on a number or
  a distance called negative declines.
- Where the image is sets a magnification's sign, and no wording of it is read: any place
  word (behind, in front, beyond, a side, left or right of) declines m = -v/u and heights.
- Heights give m = h_i/h_o only for an image not called real or inverted.
