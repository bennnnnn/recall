"""Every question a reviewer found certified wrongly (or not at all) on the readers' PR.

A card is shown only for what was read in full: a dice, die or card event with every
word accounted for; a line asked as the line through its two points and nothing else;
a measure named right before its whole number. Each row is the student's question and
the card it must get, or None for no card at all. A rounded measure says so (≈), and an
exact one is printed whole, never in e-notation.
