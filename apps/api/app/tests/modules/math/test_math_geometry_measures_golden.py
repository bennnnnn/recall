"""Golden verified blocks: one closed school geometry question per operation, byte for byte.

``golden/geometry_measures.json`` holds what ``geometry_measure_block`` builds
for one prompt per solver, read by the real extraction: every field that
differs from an empty block. A deliberate layout change regenerates it:
