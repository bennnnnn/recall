"""Answers a sweep found shown as server-verified although they were wrong.

Every row is a real prompt from the October 2026 STEM sweep (or a phrasing of
one). The rule for each family is the same: the server either answers the
question that was asked, correctly, or verifies nothing and leaves the turn to
the model. A green answer card that answers a different question is never an
option.
