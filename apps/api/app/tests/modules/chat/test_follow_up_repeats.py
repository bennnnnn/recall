"""Follow-up questions are new to the chat and fit the question asked (2026-10-24).

One study chat showed "Why use Kelvin not Celsius?" under four replies after the user
had asked it, offered "What if it was $-2x + 5 = 0$?" beside "How does it change for
$-2x + 5 = 0$?", and answered "who was Charles from Charles's law?" with "What if the
temperature doubles?". A chat the next day showed "What if perimeter was 48 cm?" after
"What if the perimeter was 48 cm?".
