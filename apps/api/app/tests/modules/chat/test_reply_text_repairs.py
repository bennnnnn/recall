"""A casual reply's text, repaired where its meaning broke (2026-10-24, one study chat).

- A quiz card marked 0.5 L right, though its own explanation ended "Correct answer is
  1.0 L (Option A)" after second-guessing itself.
- "Like texting a smart friend" read as lowercase: "2h₂ + o₂ → 2h₂o", "0 k", "10°c".
- Formulas came in grey code blocks.

Each repair touches only that: a review found the first drafts moving right quiz answers
("a common wrong answer is 0.5 L"), unfencing config lines and capitalizing variables,
paths and quoted text, all held below.
