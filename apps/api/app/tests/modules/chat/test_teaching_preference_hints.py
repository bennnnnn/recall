"""A standing teaching preference gets an acknowledgement and the plan, never a photo.

"When teaching me, explain one concept at a time…" used to get "I can't see the
image you're referring to": nothing in the prompt said it was a preference, and the
photo hint was the only instruction that seemed to fit.
