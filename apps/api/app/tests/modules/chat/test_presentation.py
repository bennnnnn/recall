"""Reply presentation: the shared corpus, plus the server-only orphan-answer rule.

`docs/fixtures/presentation_cases.json` holds every presentation case both sides
must agree on: REPL transcripts, word spaces outside inline tokens, inline code
against maths, and one calculation state per row. This test presents each input
with `present_assistant_markdown` and expects the output exactly; the phone test
(`lib/__tests__/presentationCorpus.test.ts`) does the same with
`presentAssistantMarkdown`. A presented row presents to itself, which is why the
phone can leave a persisted row as the server saved it.
