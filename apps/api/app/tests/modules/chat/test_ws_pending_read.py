"""A turn that ends first leaves its frame read running; the socket's next read takes it.

A server may lose the frame it was handing a read that is then cancelled, and
Starlette's test client does. The stopped turn of ``test_ws`` used to cancel its read
as its producer finished; a message landing in that instant was never answered, and
the socket sat until its idle timeout (CI, 2026-11-01).
