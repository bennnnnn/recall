"""A ```worked block in parts goes through the one parts layout the server's own parts use.

"A car goes 100 m in 5 s; find its speed. A train goes 300 m in 10 s; find its speed."
came back from the model (2026-11-01) with both cars' givens in one Given (d twice, t
twice), an empty "(b) speed of the car" and the train as (c): the car was worked before
its ``part`` label, which then opened a part of its own. Now a part's givens are its own,
a part that holds nothing is left out, a letter named again is that part, and the parts
are lettered in the order shown.
