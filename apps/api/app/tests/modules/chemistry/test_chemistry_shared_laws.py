"""The laws physics and chemistry share have one implementation: physics'.

A gas law, Q = mcΔT and a half-life are physics catalog laws. A chemistry question routes
to them and reads its answer in its own units: litres and atmospheres, not m³ and Pa.
Chemistry keeps what is chemistry's: Dalton, a partial pressure, a gas over water.
