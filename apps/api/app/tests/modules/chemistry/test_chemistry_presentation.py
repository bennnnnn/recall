"""A verified chemistry answer reads like a textbook's worked solution.

A law shows its equation under **Formula**; a procedure (balancing, a table lookup) shows its
rule under **Method** and checks it under **Working**. Substitutions carry units, a given an
extractor converted is shown as typed and then as used, and each unit change is a row.
