"""Chemistry QA corpus: school questions with independently worked answers.

Each expected value is the textbook formula evaluated in ``corpus_case`` units, not a
solver read-back. The test in ``test_chemistry_corpus.py`` holds two lines:

* a verified answer is never wrong: it matches the worked value to the figures it shows, or
  the question declines;
* coverage only goes up: ``COVERAGE_FLOOR`` counts the cases answered today.

Add a row whenever a phrasing is fixed or found wrong. ``MUST_DECLINE`` lists questions any
single answer to would mislead.
