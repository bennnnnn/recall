# ruff: noqa: RUF002 -- questions are typed with Unicode sub/superscripts.
"""Homework questions that used to get a wrong verified chemistry answer.

Each family is a cause, not one prompt:

- A: Unicode subscripts and superscripts (``H₂SO₄``, ``10⁻³``) cut the formula, so the
  molar mass of H₂SO₄ was the molar mass of H;
- B: a hydrate's water (``CuSO4.5H2O``, ``MgSO4·7H2O``) was dropped;
- C: "how many oxygen atoms" counted every atom, and "moles of oxygen atoms" answered a
  particle count;
- F: words chemistry did not read (``=`` as an arrow, a lowercase ``ph``).

The right outcome is the right number or no verified answer, never a wrong one.
