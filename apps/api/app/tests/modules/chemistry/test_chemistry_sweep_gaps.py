"""Readers for chemistry questions the STEM sweep found routed to physics or maths.

Each was a chemistry question another subject claimed (``stem_corpus/chemistry``):
particles to a mass, an element's share of a compound asked compound first, q = nΔH from a
burnt mass, a colligative point from moles or grams, Dalton's law with labelled or listed
pressures, a plating time, and the grams of solute in a mass-percent solution. Every reader
here answers the whole question or declines; none answers a neighbouring question.
