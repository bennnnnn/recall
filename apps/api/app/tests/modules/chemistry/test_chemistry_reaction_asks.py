"""A reaction question is answered only when every word of its ask is a known phrase.

Review (2026-10-25) of reactions told in words: "how many atoms of oxygen are needed to burn 4 g
of h2" was verified as 6.0e23 O2 molecules (the O atoms are 1.2e24); incomplete
combustion was verified as complete; H2O2 from burning hydrogen, H2 from burning methane, and
SO3 from burning sulfur were verified; "4 g of h2 burns in 100 g of air" ignored the air; "How
many H2O molecules form" was answered in grams; drinking and breathing questions were claimed;
and "mass" next to an arrow made maths lines chemistry. Each declines now, or routes as before.
