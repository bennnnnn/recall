"""A reaction follow-up reaches back only past lines that state no amount.

Review (2026-10-25): the follow-up walked back six user lines, so a heat problem in between was
hijacked ("what about 100 g of water" became the methane needed, 44.5 g), a change of a change
lost the O2 (71 g), and "back to the first one" with two reactions took the wrong one. The live
chat, whose in-between lines state no amount, still verifies.
