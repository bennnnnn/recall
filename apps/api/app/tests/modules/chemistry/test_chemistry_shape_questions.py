"""A molecule's shape asked in words is read whole and drawn, or declines.

Live failure (2026-10-25), the student's lines in order: "Why is water bent tho, co2 isnt" got
no verified answer; "Can u show me both" went to a photo search for "both"; "lol no the
molecules" got ASCII art in a code box and a broken CO2 drawing.
