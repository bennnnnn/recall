"""The behavior battery: prompts a real user sends, and how Recall should handle each.

One list feeds two runs:

- ``test_battery.py`` (CI) sends every prompt through the real turn routing with
  external services stubbed and checks the ``Expect`` fields.
- ``scripts/battery.py`` (``./scripts/dev.sh battery``) sends the same prompts to a
  running API and writes the replies, photos and sources to one report.

``gap`` names something Recall should do and does not yet. Its routing check is an
expected failure until the gap is fixed; then the check passes, the test says so, and
the ``gap`` line comes out. ``good`` says what a good reply looks like, for whoever
reads the replay report.
