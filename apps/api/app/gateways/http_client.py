"""Pooled, keep-alive httpx.AsyncClient shared across outbound gateway calls.

Each external gateway (Tavily, Google Calendar, Gmail) used to open a fresh
httpx.AsyncClient per call, paying a new TCP+TLS handshake every time even
for repeated calls to the same host within seconds. Gateways call
get_pooled_client(timeout) instead, which lazily creates one client per
distinct timeout/retry policy and reuses it for the life of the process.
