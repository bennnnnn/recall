"""What each non-chat model call cost, added to the global spend counter.

Every completion and embedding passes through a gateway, so this is the one
place that prices them all: catalog price x the provider's reported tokens,
as finalize prices a chat turn. Memory jobs, titles, compression,
follow-up questions, OCR, embeddings and the query classifiers are all metered
here. A chat turn's own stream and tool rounds are not: finalize charges them
with the turn's usage (``modules/chat/turn_settle``), so metering them here
would count them twice. The stream attempts the reply discarded (fallbacks, the
retry, the first-reply cap) are: finalize never sees them.

The write runs on its own task, so it never adds latency to the call it
measured or loses its result to the caller's deadline. Best-effort: a failed
write is logged.
