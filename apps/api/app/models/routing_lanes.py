"""The aliases routing picks by job: data, changed here and not in routing code.

``app.models.model_catalog`` serves Auto's, the photo and the tool lanes
(``auto_fast_alias``, ``vision_alias``, ``tool_selector_aliases``, ...); a background
job reads its own lane (``ROUTING.background``). ``test_model_catalog`` checks each lane
against the capability its job needs, so a lane can't point at a model that can't do it.
