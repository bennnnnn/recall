"""Chemistry as a model reads it: the laws it chooses from, and the intent its read binds to.

A read is a law's id, the values the question states and, for a law about one substance,
its formula. It becomes an intent only through the chemistry binder
(``binding.bind_chemistry_intent``), which must read the read's own English back to the
same law and values; anything else is no read.
