"""A line that only asks to see the molecules of the shape question before it.

Live failure (2026-10-25): after "Why is water bent tho, co2 isnt" the student wrote "Can u show
me both", which a photo search for "both" took, then "lol no the molecules", which got ASCII
art in a code box and a broken CO2 drawing. The server draws each molecule of a verified shape
answer (``chem_scene``), so a line that only asks to see them gets that answer again.

Every word of the line must come from one closed set: a verb that shows ("show", "draw",
"let me see", "look like"), what is shown ("both", "them", "each of them", "the molecules",
"the models", "the drawings"), and fillers ("lol", "no", "can u", "pls", "then"). Review
(2026-10-25): phrase by phrase, "show me both of them", "show me what they look like", "show
us both" and "draw both" fell through to a photo search or a generated picture. A word for a
real photo ("photo", "pic", "image", "real") is never this line: "show me a photo of both" stays
a photo. The noun alone counts too ("lol no the molecules"). The shape question is the latest
earlier user line that is not such a line itself; any other line in between declines, so "show
me both" after a crocodile and an alligator is not chemistry's.
