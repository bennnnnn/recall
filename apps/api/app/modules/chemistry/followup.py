"""Replay the previous chemistry problem when this line only continues it.

Each shape declines instead of guessing: explain the result, ask for another
quantity of the same setup ("and the pOH?"), or replace or scale one given
("and 0.001 M?", "what if the concentration doubles?"). A reaction problem also
takes an amount or an ask of one of its substances ("what if i only had 16g of
o2", "and how much o2 do i need": ``reaction_followup.py``). A new
question that brings its own data is not a follow-up. Exact phrases such as
``why`` and ``explain`` stay on the shared continuation list; this resolver
is the line that is not one of those phrases.
