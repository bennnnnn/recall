"""How a question wrote its numbers, so the answer keeps that precision.

A chemistry answer carries as many significant figures as the least precise value the
question measured, the rule a chemistry class grades, kept between two and four. A value the
student typed is echoed as typed, trailing zeros included: 1.10 V is not 1.1 V. A pH or a pK is
a logarithm, so its precision is its decimal places: as many as the concentration it came from
has significant figures, or as many as a typed pH, pOH or pK has decimals. A sum or difference of
the givens (a cell potential, Hess's law) keeps the fewest decimal places instead: 0.34 V and
−0.76 V make 1.10 V.
