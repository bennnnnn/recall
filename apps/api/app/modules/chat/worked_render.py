"""A worked solution the model wrote as parts, laid out as a verified reply is.

Every section goes through ``render_workout`` (``services/workout.py``), the renderer of
every verified maths, physics and chemistry reply: **Given** (each value on its line, then
the ``where`` line naming them), **Required**, **Solution**, the formula under its name's
heading (``formula_heading``: **Average speed formula**; **Formula** with no name),
``Solve for`` lines, **Substitution** or **Steps**, then **Answer** with the value. A
question in parts is laid out as a verified one in parts: one Given (a value only some
parts use lettered by them) and what is asked once, then **Solution** and each part under
its letter, closed by its own **Answer (a)**, a hairline between parts. The value under
**Answer** becomes the card in finalize (``chat.finalize_subjects.check_working``), marked
``verified: false``: no solver checked it.
