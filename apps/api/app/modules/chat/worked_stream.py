"""The reply's tokens on their way to the phone: scaffolding out, a ```worked block laid out.

A turn whose calculation no solver checked asks the model for its solution as a ```worked
block of records (``worked_solution``). ``WorkedFilter`` reads the block as it streams and
puts out the layout instead (``worked_render``): each record is laid out as soon as its
line ends, so the reply streams as it did, section by section, never as raw records. The
text around the block passes through unchanged. A block with no valid record is shown as
the model wrote it; a model that writes no block gets today's reply.

``ReplyFilter`` chains the scaffold filter and this one for ``stream_paths``. The text the
phone was sent stays a prefix of the reply: a record out of order (a given after the
substitution) would move what was drawn, so the saved reply takes the corrected text, and
``done`` carries it (``StreamAccum.rewritten``).
