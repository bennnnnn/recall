"""Emoji where the user's setting puts them (``users.emoji_use``, Settings → Emoji).

The prompt says where, and a model does not always listen: at "A few", "what are the
benefits of drinking water" ended every list line with an emoji ("…the fuel for that
system 🌡️") instead of leading its label, and 🌊 opened the reply. The setting is kept
here:

- ``off``: no emoji, unless the user wrote one (then the reply may mirror it).
- ``some``: one emoji may lead a heading, a list item or a bold label line; one written
  later in such a line moves to its front, and any in a sentence goes.
- ``more``: as written.

A worked maths, physics or chemistry solution (Given, Find, Substitution, Answer…) has
none at any setting: the prompt says so, and at "Lots" its headings still got them. Nor
does any answer to a school exercise, or a turn a subject's solver read: at "Lots" a
textbook's answers ended "**D. Milk** … 💧" and "**Birr 1,551.67**. 💰" (2026-10-31).

Fences (code, cards, the clarify card's options), inline code and table rows are never
touched, nor is a lesson (its 🐍 and 🎉 are the lesson's own) or server text.
