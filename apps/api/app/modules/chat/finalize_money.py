"""Finalize pass for a money reply: the market note and the calculator card under it.

The ``calculator`` fence is the server's: one the model wrote is dropped on every turn,
and a money turn gets the one ``modules/money`` builds, with today's average when the
lookup that started with the turn found one. A reply in English whose stated payment is
not the card's gets the card's figures in a line (``money/agreement``). A stopped reply
adds nothing.
