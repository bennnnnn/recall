"""Chat-template control tokens a model leaks into its reply.

A provider's end-of-turn token is the model's own signal, never text for a reader: a
Grade 10 answer card ended "2 x 10^-8 s<|im_end|>" and the reply then ran "</|im_end|>"
for 1,100 lines, to the length limit (2026-10-30). A reply about chat templates writes the
same tokens on purpose, so only a leak's own shape is acted on: a token ending the reply or
an answer card, or one token over and over. Code a reply quotes (a fence, `inline` code) is
never touched.

A run of one token ends the stream: the model is no longer writing a reply, and reading on
kept the user waiting up to the stream's cap and marked a clean reply cut short (2026-11-01).
