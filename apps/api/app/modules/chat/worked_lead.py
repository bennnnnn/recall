"""A worked solution states its result once, after the working, never above it.

Told to answer first, a model opened worked replies with a number it had not worked yet:
"The ratio of fuel used … is **5 : 7**" over working and a card that found 4 : 5, and
"The car covers **290 m**" over a sum of 310 m (a Class 9 book, 2026-10-30); the prompt
saying a calculation opens with its working did not hold. Right, it said the answer twice:
"**x = 3**" over Given, Required, Solution and a card showing x = 3 (2026-11-07), where a
textbook, and the reply's own layout, give the result once, at the end. In a reply with a
worked section (Given, Working, Solution, Required, Formula, Substitution or Steps) and an
answer card below it, a short lead above the section stating a number the working never
reaches (a guess) or a number a card shows (the answer, early) goes.
A heading, a photo, a part, a note or a lead with neither stays ("the car does not reach
100 m in 5 s" over a card of 25 m), and so does a long lead, which may be an answer of its
own.

Below the cards it is not said again either (``drop_restated_tail``): asked to write
nothing outside its ```worked block, a model still closed with "The car's speed is
**20 m/s**, and the train's speed is **30 m/s**." under two cards showing just that
(2026-11-02). A short paragraph after the last card that states only the cards' numbers,
in words the reply or the question already holds, goes; a picture, or a sentence with a
number or a word of its own (a caveat, a direction the card lacks), stays.
