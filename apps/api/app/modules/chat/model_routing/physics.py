# Deliberately a separate list from `modules.physics.registry.PHYSICS_CUES` /
# `has_supported_physics_cue`, not a duplicate of it: that one gates "the
# solver's extractors might handle this text," which has grown to twenty
# kinds. This one gates "escalate Auto to the smarter model," which some
# entries here now overlap with a covered kind (momentum, simple harmonic,
# centripetal) — kept anyway, since a smarter model's surrounding
# explanation is still worth it even when the number itself is guaranteed.
# If that stops being true for a given phrase, prune it here; don't point
# this at `has_supported_physics_cue` — inverting the gate would escalate
# exactly the questions the solver already has covered, and stop escalating
# the ones it doesn't, which is backwards from this function's purpose.
