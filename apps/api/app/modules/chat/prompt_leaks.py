"""A sentence that tells the user about the prompt's own parts comes off a reply.

An investing answer opened: "The memory block contains details that don't match this
conversation. It names a different person and preferences that conflict with what
you've told me, so I'm setting it aside and answering from what you've shared, Dev."
(live chat, 2026-10-25). The prompt asks for no such line (``PRIVACY_HINT``, the saved
memory preamble); this pass removes the ones a model writes anyway.

It is deliberately narrow. A sentence goes only when it names an internal part from a
closed list: a label only Recall's prompt uses ("[Chemistry note]", "saved memory
block", "BEGIN UNTRUSTED CONTENT"), or a word that also has an everyday meaning
("memory block" in C, "system prompt" in prompt writing) together with words about
this user's chat with Recall ("this conversation", "what you've told me", "your … on
file"; not a bare "your name" or "about you", which an answer about a CMS or an LLM
uses). The sentence after it goes too when it points back ("It names a different
person…"). Never inside a code fence, an inline code span, a table, a heading or a
quote, never the whole reply, and never on a turn whose recent messages name these
parts or prompt writing, or whose message asks about language models or Recall's memory.
