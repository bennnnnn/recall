"""Is the user asking for a detail of their own saved profile ("what's my second language")?

A yes is answered from memory without the model (``turn_prep/instant.py``), so a wrong yes
is a wrong reply: "Who is the principal of my school?" got "I don't have your education
level saved." The profile word has to be the thing asked for, the user's own:

- "what's my education level", "my second langauge", "do you know my school?"
- "which school do I go to", "what grade am I in", "what languages do I speak"
- "where do I live", "where am I from", "where did I study"

Not a profile question: something else at the school ("the principal of my school", "the
rules at my university"), something the school or grade does ("when does my school start",
"my grades dropped"), someone else's ("what grade should my son be in"), or a choice to make
("what language should I learn").
