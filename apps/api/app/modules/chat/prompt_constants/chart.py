"""A numeric chart turn: what reads as one, and the one chart contract.

The phone draws a ```chart fence with Vega-Lite whose data is written inline
(``apps/mobile/lib/chartSpec.ts``); anything else shows the chart's data as a table
instead. ``CHART_FORMAT_HINT`` names only the shapes it draws. Their examples are
``chart_shapes.json``, and the phone's tests draw every one of them
(``apps/mobile/lib/__tests__/chartShapes.test.ts``), so the hint cannot promise a
shape the phone leaves blank. A curve y = f(x) is not one of them: the server samples
it with SymPy (``modules/math/chart_formula.py``).
