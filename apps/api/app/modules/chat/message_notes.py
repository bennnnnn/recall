"""What the latest message is, said beside it: a list of values, "What?" or "How?" at the
last reply, the user's Emoji setting, and the language it is written in.

These sit nearest the user's turn (``prompt_sections.CONTEXT_SECTIONS``): a small model
follows the note closest to the message. A lesson, its outline and a clarify card read
"I don't get it" their own way (a new explanation under the lesson's title, the request
answered now), so the "say it again" note stays out of them.
