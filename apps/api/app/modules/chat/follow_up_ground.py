"""Whether a reply still works a subject problem: the problem's own ground it reuses.

Live (2026-10-25, one chat with the free model): two lines after a rectangle problem,
"cool. i'm going to lisbon next month for 4 days, what should i not miss?" got "What if
perimeter was 48 cm?" under its travel tips. A line that names a topic of its own
(``follow_up_thread``) is checked here against its reply. Still on the problem, a reply
reuses its ground: its nouns ("perimeter", "ball"), its numbers with their units (19.8 m/s,
written any way), and its maths ("x^2 - 5x + 6", "x = 2", the variable x). A day plan's
"Day 1" or a recipe's "2 eggs" is no ground, a single digit counts only with its unit, and
one noun is not enough: a Lisbon itinerary may mention "the Bairro Alto area".
