"""Sentences a reply says about the turn rather than to the user.

Live chat (2026-10-25): "1" and "Okay." were answered "Got it. It's currently Sunday,
October 25, 2026, 6:15 PM EDT." The prompt gives every reply the clock, and a short turn
read it back as filler. A sentence that is today's date and time and nothing else goes
when the user's message is not about a time, a day or a date. "It's Sunday, October 25,
2026, so the post office is closed" says something, and stays. A yes to an offer was
answered "Dev, you accepted my offer, so here is…": the lead-in about the yes goes.
