"""A short reply that says it cannot see the clock, when the user asked the clock.

The finalize pass swaps such a reply for the clock the app always has
(``finalize_text.fix_clock``). The user's message decides, not the reply's wording: it
must ask the local clock in so many words ("what time is it", "whats the time rn", "do
you know what time it is", "today's date") and name nothing else live. Read from the
reply, "I don't have access to real-time information, so I can't tell you tomorrow's
weather in Chicago" became "Sunday, October 25, 2026, 3:22:15 PM EDT" (live chat,
2026-10-25), and two review rounds still found replies about store hours, the time in
Tokyo or daylight saving swapped, and true clock denials missed.
