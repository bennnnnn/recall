"""A worked solution the model writes as parts, read and validated before it is laid out.

When no solver checked a calculation, the model wrote the worked layout itself and it came
out differently each time: bold inline "**Given:** …", no Answer heading, no card
(2026-11-01). Now the model writes the parts in a ```worked block, one record per line,
its fields split by ``|`` (``prompt_constants.worked``):

    given: t | 40 | min | time | 2400\\,\\mathrm{s}
    given (b): t | 1 | s | time
    required: s | displacement
    formula: Constant velocity | s = v t
    solve_for: t | t = \\frac{s}{v}
    step: 2x = 8 | subtract 3 from both sides
    substitution: s = 20 \\times 120
    answer: s | 2400 | m | east
    part: a | Distance in centimetres

Lines, not JSON: LaTeX in a JSON string loses its backslashes silently (the ``\\t`` of
``\\times`` is a tab), and a line is whole as soon as it ends, so the layout streams.
Each record is validated with Pydantic (CLAUDE.md golden rule 6); a line that is no
record, or fails, is left out. ``worked_render`` lays the solution out with
``render_workout``, the renderer of every verified reply.
