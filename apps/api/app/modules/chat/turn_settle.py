"""Settle a finished turn in the database: its reply row, today's usage and quota.

``finalize_stream_turn_db`` saves the assistant reply (swapping out the one a
regenerate replaces), adds the turn's weighted tokens to the day's aggregate and
settles the turn's reservation to its actual usage. ``seed_usage_from_db`` reads
that aggregate back when Redis lost today's counter.
The jobs that follow a saved turn are ``post_turn``.
