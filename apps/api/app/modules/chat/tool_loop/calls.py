"""Answering each call of a selection round: refuse it, or run it and merge what it found.

Every call gets exactly one tool message, in order, so the provider accepts the
message list. A call over the round's cap, past its deadline, for a tool this turn
was not offered, or for a trig solve that would drop the user's domain is refused
in that message and never runs.

Calls to different tools run at once under the round's one deadline; calls to the same
tool run one after another, in order (a search runs once per turn and its repeats reuse
the first result; solves share the SymPy pool). What each found merges in call order,
so the turn's verified fences and sources never depend on which call finished first.
