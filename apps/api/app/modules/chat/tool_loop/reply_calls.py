"""The ``web_search`` tool on the reply's own model call.

Word rules alone decided search in production: the classifier round that read the
rest cost every turn a model call before its first word, so it was turned off, and
"who won the champions league" or "what's the population of Ethiopia" was answered
from training data. A turn the rules neither searched nor ruled out now offers the
tool to the model writing the reply. It answers at once, or calls ``web_search`` and
answers in a second call that reads the results. A reply that needs no search costs
nothing more.
