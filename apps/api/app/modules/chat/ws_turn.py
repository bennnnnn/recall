"""One chat turn over an open WebSocket: start, tokens, Stop, stream_end, done.

``ws_api`` reads the socket's frames and hands each message or regenerate here.
The producer runs the turn on its own task while this side keeps reading the
socket for a cancel; both go through the one ``stop`` a server shutdown uses too.
The next turn's frame may arrive once ``stream_end`` is out: it waits for this
turn's ``done`` and runs next, as a new SSE turn waits on the previous save.
