"""A generic closing line ("Let me know if you have any other questions") comes off a reply.

FORMAT_CONTRACT already asks for no such ending; this pass removes the ones a model writes
anyway. It is deliberately narrow: only the reply's last line, only a sentence from the fixed
list in ``_CLOSER``, never inside a code fence, a quote, a table or a list, never the whole
reply, and never on a turn whose words the user shaped: a draft, a rewrite or a translation
(an email may end "Let me know if you have any questions"), or a message that quotes a closer.
A concrete offer ("Let me know if you want it in TypeScript") is not on the list.
