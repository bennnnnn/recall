"""Read the turn's message once, in the SymPy pool, before code on the event loop asks.

Routing, the prompt builder, the subject fetch, the tool loop and the finalize passes
all ask the same readings of the message: its plan, its subject, whether physics or
maths claims it, its maths and physics intents. ``ask_turn_readings`` asks each of them
in a pool worker, where a hostile message stops at the timeout, and the turn keeps the
answers (``app/core/readings.py``). Workers import this module, so it stays light:
nothing here may import the prompt, attachment or database stack.
