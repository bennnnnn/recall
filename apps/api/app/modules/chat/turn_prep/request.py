"""What one turn asks for, and who is asking.

``TurnRequest`` is what new turns and regenerate hand ``build_stream_prompt_context``.
``TurnIdentity`` is the user, chat and turn mode that turn runs as, with its geo and
clock already resolved; the instant replies, follow-ups and augmentation read it.
