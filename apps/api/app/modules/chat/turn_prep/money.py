"""A loan, card or savings question: the money module's block and card for this turn.

It runs beside the rest of the prompt's preparation. One request of a multi-part
message may be the money one; the first part that reads as money is used. A part may
also change the chat's last money request ("what if i only do 3 years instead"), which
the user's earlier lines in the turn's window give, each in the parts its own turn read
(their plans are read in the pool with the message, ``reading``); the server works that
one too.
