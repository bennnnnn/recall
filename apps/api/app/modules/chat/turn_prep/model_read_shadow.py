"""The model reader in shadow: it reads a STEM question beside the patterns.

With ``model_reader_shadow_enabled`` on, a share (``model_reader_shadow_rate``) of the turns
the subject read calls maths, physics or chemistry, with no instant reply, start
``model_reader``'s read of the message. Nothing awaits it: the turn's trace line
(``turn_trace``) says ``pending`` while it reads, and it logs its own ``turn_model_read``
line when it finishes, bounded by its calls' own timeouts. It skips at the day's spend cap
(docs/MODEL_READER.md). In shadow the read never reaches the reply.

A turn no solver verified also starts the read, every time, when the second opinion is on
(``chat.second_opinion``): it runs beside the reply, and the finalize pass awaits it.
