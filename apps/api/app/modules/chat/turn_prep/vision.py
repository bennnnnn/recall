"""The images a new turn's prompt carries: this turn's photos, or the user's earlier ones.

A photo sent now is injected from the bytes attachment processing already read. A
follow-up about an earlier photo reads that photo again, so the model looks at it
rather than at its marker, and is told plainly when it is gone. Only the user's own
photos go back in: a picture Recall generated is the model's own work, and sending
it again would move every later turn onto a photo model for nothing.

An earlier photo is read again only while the conversation is still about it: it
was sent in the user's previous message (the reply in between was about it), or
this message names a picture ("the photo", "that screenshot": the image intents'
nouns plus the words people use for a picture they sent). Otherwise every later turn of a chat that once had a
photo downloaded it again and ran on the vision model. A storage outage here
cannot fail the turn: the user's message is already saved, so the turn goes on
without the photo and the model is told it cannot see it.
