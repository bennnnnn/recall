"""A terse follow-up that points back at the problem before it.

"how?" after a solved equation, "check my answer: x = 6", "what about 2 moles?"
after a stoichiometry question, "how far does it go?" after a projectile. Each one
goes back through its subject's verified solver instead of asking the language
model to invent a fresh method. Maths is asked first, then chemistry, then physics;
the first subject that claims the line owns the turn.
