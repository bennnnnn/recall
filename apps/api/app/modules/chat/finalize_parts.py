"""Finalize passes for the server's part of a multi-part reply.

"Switch to dark mode and tell me a joke": the model tells the joke and the settings
card goes under it. "Draw a cat wearing a hat and also explain black holes": the
picture drawn beside the answer goes above it, or a line says why it could not.
``chat/finalize_passes.py`` lists them in order. Both commit the text: ``done``
carries what they added, so a later pass's failure keeps it. Each request the model
answered in its own section is set off from the next by a hairline.
