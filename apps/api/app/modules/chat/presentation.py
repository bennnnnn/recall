"""Assistant Markdown presentation: REPL transcripts, boundaries, then calculation rows.

The finalize pass, the direct replies and live talk run it before a reply is saved, so a
persisted assistant row is already presented. The phone shows rows saved from its
``SERVER_PRESENTATION_CUTOVER`` as saved and presents only the text still streaming and
older rows. Its twin is ``apps/mobile/lib/markdown/presentation.ts``;
docs/fixtures/presentation_cases.json holds both to the same output.
