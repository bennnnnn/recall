"""A verified result answers the question asked, all of it, or is not shown.

A subject reader answers one thing. A question in parts, with several reactions, or with
options to choose from asks more, and the one thing it answered was shown as the checked
answer: "Electrons = 31" for "how many electrons in its valence shell? a 5 b 4 c 3 d 2",
"6" for "belongs to group: a IIIA b IVA c VIA d VIIA", "2 Fe + O₂ → 2 FeO" for the option
that forms iron(II) oxide, "3:2" for a five-part question, and part (a) alone of four pH
calculations (2026-10-30, Ethiopian Grade 7-12 chemistry books). Such a result is dropped
whole (its prompt block, its card and its instant reply), and the model answers the
question; a result that answers every part, or is one of the options, stays.
