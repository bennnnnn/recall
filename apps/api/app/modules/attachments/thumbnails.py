"""Gallery and chat thumbnails (``GET /attachments/{id}/file?w=``).

Every ``?w=`` request used to download the whole object and decode it on the
default thread pool, so a Library page of 30 tiles meant 30 full downloads and
decodes at once. A width now rounds up to one of a few sizes; each size is made
once, kept beside the original under ``{storage_key}.thumbs/`` and read from there
afterwards. Making one waits on a process-wide limit
(``attachment_thumbnail_concurrency``). The caller checks ownership first.
