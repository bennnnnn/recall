"""The one reader of a day and a clock in the user's words.

"remind me tomorrow at 6pm to call mom", "remind me tmrw 8am buy injera",
"reminder: renew my passport, oct 20 at 10am", "set a reminder saturday 11am -
meet abel". In a new reminder, a clock without am/pm counts only beside a part
of the day ("tonight at 9", "9 in the morning"); otherwise the app asks when.

A bare hour is the evening when it is the whole reply to "when?" or ends a
change ("make it 7"): "6" and "6:30" are 6 PM and 6:30 PM, and "18" stays
18:00. "0" is no clock; midnight is said as midnight or 12am. An am/pm clock
has hours 1 to 12 everywhere.
