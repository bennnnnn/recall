"""Sentences in a reply that say Recall cannot keep reminders.

Live (2026-10-25): asked "what do you remember about me so far?", a reply listed the
reminder card offered earlier and went on "I can't set reminders from here, though, so
you'll want to set that one in your own reminder app." Recall sets them: a card the user
taps. ``without_denials`` drops those sentences and keeps the rest of the reply.

A denial says the assistant cannot set or add reminders at all, or sends the user to their
own reminder app for one. A limit is no denial: "I can't add reminders to Apple Reminders
directly", "I can't set reminders that repeat every other Tuesday", anything about the
phone or another app, and "I can't remind you enough how much sleep matters". A denial
followed by "but you can…" keeps what comes after the "but".
