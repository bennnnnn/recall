"""A yes to the last reply's offer to set a reminder is that request.

Live (2026-10-25): the reply ended "Would you like me to set up that **Practice list
comprehensions** reminder for tomorrow (Monday) at 7:00 PM?" and the user said "yes". The
turn read "yes" alone: no To-do instructions reached the model, which wrote "Setting that
reminder for you now!" with no card, and nothing was saved. A short yes right after a
reply whose last question offers a reminder now loads the To-do block like the request
it answers, and the offer's own day and clock count as said: the user agreed to them.
