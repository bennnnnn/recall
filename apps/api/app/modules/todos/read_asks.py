"""Whether a message asks what is saved, so the saved rows answer it.

Live (2026-10-25): "ok last thing, what's on my to do list right now?" and "hmm are you
sure? check my to-do list again" were answered by the model from the chat. It listed a
reminder whose card was never tapped, and left out the one saved for that evening. Only
"what are my reminders" and the like were read, and only at the very start of the
message. The app calls the list To-do: "to-do list", "to do list" and "todo list" are how
people name it, and each is read as one. A clause asks it when it is the read and
nothing more, but for when ("…right now", "…for tomorrow", "…at 3pm") and a word like
"again" or "please": "check my todo list app for bugs" asks about code. The clauses
beside it may only be chatter ("ok last thing, what's on…", "hmm are you sure? check
my…"): "Is Monday a holiday? what's on my schedule" keeps its holiday, and "what's on my
to-do list? push gym to friday" its move.
