"""What a message asks of images, read with the chat so far: a real photo, a picture, or neither.

The one reader. The chat turn's intercept (``chat/turn_intercepts.py``) and the
phone's composer (``POST /images/intent``) both ask here, so a picture the
composer draws is the picture the chat turn would draw. The word rules live in
``gen_intent.py`` and ``lookup_intent.py``.
