"""Turn reading — what a message says, read from its words alone.

The pure readers chat's prompt used to keep beside its copy (structure ticket ST-04): a
confirmation, a light turn, a locale cue, code, a chart, a lesson step, a school exercise.
Nothing here reaches a database, a cache, the network or a model, and nothing here is
prompt text; chat's ``prompt_constants`` keeps the copy these readers choose between.
Every module, chat included, imports a reader from here and never through chat.
