"""What one turn's message is, read once: the turn's ``TurnReading`` (structure ticket ST-05).

The turn's decisions used to be recomputed where each was used, from whatever text that
caller held. The reading is built once from the pooled read of the message
(``chat.turn_prep.reading.read_turn``) and kept for the turn; callers read its fields.
It holds the plan and whether the message asks to be taught; the subject decision joins
it next, with the reason code the turn's trace line records. (Small talk is the turn's
mode, ``chat.turn_prep.mode``: it reads the window, not only the message.)
