"""What a message is about, for the notes beside it: someone's own matter, or the world.

A school exercise and a question about the world get notes asking for the textbook's
answer (``school_question``). A message about the asker, their team or app, the
assistant, code, anything that changes (news, prices, forecasts, travel) or a matter of
taste never does: "Calculate my BMI", "Determine the root cause of the 502s on our nginx
server", "Mark says Bitcoin will hit 200k. Is he right?" and "Which neighbourhood is
safer: (a) Brooklyn (b) Queens (c) Bronx?" were read as exercises in review
(2026-10-30), and an exercise is offered no web search.
