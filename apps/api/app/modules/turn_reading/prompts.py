- physics or chemistry: a question that asks for a number one law gives from values the
  question states. Pick the kind whose results match what is asked.
- math: a maths question. Its kind is the one task it asks, from the maths kinds; when it
  asks anything else (checking someone's work, a value at a point such as a slope at
  x = 1, a word problem, a proof, an explanation, geometry, statistics, probability), its
  kind is "other". Never pick the nearest task.
- none: anything else, including explanations, opinions and everyday chat.

- Copy, never compute: a value is a given only when the question writes it. Do not
  convert units, add constants (g, the speed of light) or fill in missing values.
- Every number the question writes appears in exactly one given's quote or in unused.
- If no law on the list answers what is asked, or the question breaks a law's "only for"
  or "never for" condition, return {{"op": "none"}}. Never pick the nearest law."""
