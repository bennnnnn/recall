"""Validate solver-owned answer, arithmetic, geometry, and graph fences.

The model is asked to explain in Markdown + ``$...$``. Recall attaches
solver-owned `` ```answer `` / `` ```graph `` / `` ```geometry `` after the
stream from ``VerifiedMathBlock``. If the model still emitted a same-kind
fence, it is replaced with the canonical JSON (or answer body) so a
drifted or hallucinated number never reaches the user.

When this turn produced a canonical `` ```graph `` fence but it (or the
substituted JSON) is still sparse, we densify by re-sampling that *verified*
expression. Model-emitted geometry/graph JSON with no matching canonical
fence is stripped — schema-valid invented numbers must not ship as if
verified. Discrete point markers and vertical lines stay untouched.

After rewriting any fences the model still produced, we append canonical
fences that are missing so the client always gets the solver-owned
diagram. The verified `` ```answer `` pill lands under the reply's **Answer**
heading in place of the model's own final line (``land_answer_card``), or at
the end when the reply has no Answer section. A *different* final value in the
prose gets one correction line right above it. Every pill this module writes
carries the server's ``verified: true`` marker; a model's own answer fence
never does.
