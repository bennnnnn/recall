"""The form a "simplify" answer certifies: the one a school book prints.

SymPy's ``simplify`` keeps the form with the fewest operations, and on a tie or under
the principal complex branch that is not the book's: ``∛(162x⁵)/∛(3x²)`` stayed
``3∛2·∛(x⁵)/|x^(2/3)|``, ``(x-1)/(x³-1)`` was left uncancelled and ``x³ + x²`` came back
factored. Three rules, each one for every expression of its kind:

- An odd root of a real number is the real root (``∛(-8) = -2``). The radicals are
  combined as if every letter were positive, and that form is kept only when it equals
  the expression for every real value of its letters (``real_reading.agrees_on_reals``);
  otherwise SymPy's own form stands.
- A rational expression is in lowest terms: no factor is left common to the numerator
  and the denominator.
- A sum of polynomial terms with like terms or brackets is its collected terms, as long as
  collecting them is no longer than what was written: ``(x+1)² - 1`` is ``x² + 2x``, while
  ``(x+1)¹⁰ - 1``, a sum already collected and a product the student wrote keep SymPy's
  form.

Length alone does not decide: ``1/x + 1/(x+1)`` as one fraction is longer, and it is the
book's answer.
