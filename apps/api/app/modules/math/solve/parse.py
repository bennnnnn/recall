    ATTRIBUTE ACCESS on an already-resolved object. A Symbol instance is a

    reachable from a plain chat message (math/tools keyword-triggered
    intent extraction has no sanitization) and from the sympy MCP tool the
    model can call directly. SymPy's own docs are explicit that
    sympify/parse_expr must never see untrusted input un-validated.
