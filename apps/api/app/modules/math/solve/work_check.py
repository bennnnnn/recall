"""Check a student's worked lines against the problem they started from.

Each line is one relation in one unknown. A line is right when it has exactly
the solutions of the first line (the problem as the student wrote it); SymPy's
``solveset`` over the reals decides. The first line that changes the solutions
holds the mistake, and ``work_slips`` names what went wrong in the move to it.
Every corrected line a diagnosis proposes is itself checked, and the steps
from there to the answer are the verified equation and inequality traces.

Scope is deliberately narrow: polynomial sides of degree at most two in one
unknown. Anything else returns None, and the message keeps the normal path.
