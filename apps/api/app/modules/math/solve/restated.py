"""Whether a rewrite's card only restates the root it was asked to take.

"Find the cube root of 27a^3 + 54a^2b + 36ab^2 + 8b^3." was read by a model as a
simplification of (27a^3 + …)^(1/3); SymPy left the root on the whole expression, and the
checked card was \\sqrt[3]{27 a^{3} + …}: the question itself (2026-11-01; right: 3a + 2b).
A card that is a root of the very sum it was given, the root not taken, answers nothing; a
root of one term (``cbrt(x^2)``) may well be the simplest form.

The card and the expression are compared as SymPy trees parsed as written, never as text,
so 1/(x - 1) is no part of (x+1)/(x-1) - x/(x-1). A card equal to an expression with no root
left on it is an answer: "simplify (x+1)/(x-1)" is already simplest, its excluded value
stated beside it, and so is "factor x^2 + 1". A number, one letter or an equation is never
a restatement.
