"""Which letters of a written expression the writer used as names.

Implicit multiplication splits any letter run it cannot resolve, so a parse
can hold symbols nobody wrote: ``log2(x)`` became ``2*g*l*o*x`` and ``5 kg``
became ``5*g*k``. Each then solved as ordinary algebra and was certified.

Two more spellings are not names either. A unit after a number is part of a
quantity: "v = 3 x 10^8 m/s" solved for m, "t = 2.02 s" for s and "m/q =
1.25 x 10^-6 kg/C" for C. A letter with a subscript (``P1``, ``V2``, ``v0``,
``NH3``) names one quantity, which single-letter algebra would read as ``P·1``
or ``V²``. A parse that holds either is not what was written.

Nor is a name the parser does not know. A model's reading of "the cube root of 27a^3 + …"
wrote ``cube_root(27a^3 + …)``: the parser made ``cube_root`` one symbol times the
polynomial, "simplified" it to itself and certified the question as its answer
(2026-11-01). ``cuberoot(8)`` would have been the letters c·u·b·e·r·o·o·t times 8. A name
must be a function or constant SymPy knows, a Greek letter, a letter with a subscript
(``x_1``), a name the caller declared, or one-letter variables written together (``ab``,
``3abc``, ``lwh``, ``abcd``): never a word.
