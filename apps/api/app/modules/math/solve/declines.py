"""Maths declines: a failed SymPy step drops its trace and says why; a bug still raises in tests.

A decline is designed behaviour. When SymPy cannot do a step here (no polynomial form, an
unsolvable equation, a sign it cannot decide), the check or trace that needed it is dropped and
the turn keeps its model path. The same ``except Exception`` would also swallow an
``AttributeError`` or ``NameError`` from a refactor, so this module is the one place that tells
the two apart:

- ``@declines(default)`` wraps a function whose whole body is the attempt;
- ``with sympy_decline() as declined:`` wraps part of one; ``declined`` is true afterwards when
  the block failed, so the caller returns its own default (a fresh ``[]`` each time).

Each decline is logged at DEBUG (where, the exception type, a short message) and counted in an
in-process ``Counter`` keyed by (where, exception type), read with ``decline_counts()``. The
counter is per process: a SymPy pool worker keeps its own, and nothing exports it yet.

Outside strict mode every ``Exception`` declines except ``TimeoutError`` (the SymPy pool's
timeout), as the plain ``except Exception`` it replaces did. A ``BaseException`` (cancellation,
``KeyboardInterrupt``) always passes through.

With ``RECALL_STRICT_DECLINES=1`` (the test run sets it in ``app/tests/conftest.py``) a
programming error raises instead: an ``AttributeError``, ``NameError`` (``UnboundLocalError``),
``KeyError``, ``ImportError``, ``AssertionError`` or ``TypeError`` raised in our own code. The
same types raised inside SymPy or mpmath are SymPy failing on the input, so they still decline:
an exception class SymPy or mpmath defines, or one whose nearest frame outside the standard
library is SymPy's, mpmath's or code ``lambdify`` generated (``bool(x < 0)`` on a symbolic
``x`` raises its ``TypeError`` in SymPy). The nearest ``app`` frame makes it ours. Everything
else (``ValueError``, ``ArithmeticError``, ``RecursionError``, ``NotImplementedError``,
``IndexError``, SymPy's own errors) declines in both modes.
