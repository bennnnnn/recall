"""A model's reading of a problem: certified only as the user's own maths.

SymPy checks the arithmetic of the equations it is given, not that they say what the
problem says (2026-11-01: a remainder problem read as 9B = 3 gave a checked A = -61/3; a tax
that "continues without end" summed over three rounds gave a checked 3920 for 5000).

- A photo's equations are certified only when they are on the page as read
  (``image_intent_on_the_page``); the typed extraction is held to the user's text the same
  way in ``tools/prompt.py``.
- A word problem's translation is never a verified card: its setup and SymPy's solution go
  to the model as an unchecked setup to check against the words (``unchecked_setup``).
