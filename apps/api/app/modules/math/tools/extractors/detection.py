"""The extractors the math gate asks once no lexical signal has fired.

These are the requests that carry no equation, operator or command word for a
lexical signal to see, so only the grammar that reads them can say they are maths.
Each read goes through ``readings.read``, and the extraction step that follows a
yes reuses it rather than running the extractor again.

This is a chosen few, not the whole registry: some registry extractors read prose
("compare React and Vue" as two curves) and rely on the gate to keep it away.
