"""Carry today's limits from a deleted account to the next one for the same person.

Quota counters are keyed by user id, so deleting an account and signing in
again with the same Google or Apple login, or with the other provider on the
same email address, would otherwise start every daily cap, and this month's
live talk minutes, from zero.

Account delete stores what the account had used under one Redis key per sign-in
identity, ``quota_carry:<HMAC-SHA256(jwt_secret, "quota-carry:google:<sub>")>``, and
one for the account's email, ``quota_carry:<HMAC-SHA256(jwt_secret,
"quota-carry-email:<address>")>``: never the raw provider subject, never the address,
never the user id (so the account's Redis sweep, which deletes every key naming the
user id, leaves them). Each holds the same counts and expires when the UTC month ends.
An account with no email stores only its identity keys. The email key closed a gap:
delete an Apple account on x@icloud.com, sign in with Google on the same address, and
the new account's day started again from zero, its snapshot filed only under the
Apple id.

The address is trimmed and lower-cased before it is hashed (``normalised_email``) and
nothing else: no provider's own rules (Gmail's dots or ``+tags``), which would merge
addresses that are different mailboxes elsewhere.

When sign-in creates a new user, or links an identity to the existing account that
holds its email (``service._link_identity``), that account's counters are raised to
the identity's snapshot and the email's (each raise-only, so applying both leaves each
counter at the larger of the two, never summed), and every key applied is deleted.

Both sides fail closed. A delete whose counters cannot be stored is refused with
``RedisUnavailableError`` (503 ``unavailable``), before anything is undone, and the phone
asks for a retry. A new account or link whose snapshots cannot be read or applied is
not saved: sign-in answers 503 ``sign_in_unavailable`` and its retry restores. Both were
best-effort, so Redis failing at either step started the same sign-in from zero.
