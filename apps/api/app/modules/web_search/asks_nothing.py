"""Does this turn ask to know anything? A turn that doesn't never searches.

"Today", "now", "latest" and "news" made every sentence that held them look
live: "you're doing a great job today", "I just watched the news and I feel
overwhelmed", "write a short poem about today" all paid for a search. A time
word only matters in a turn that asks for something out in the world. Three
shapes ask for nothing to look up:

- A statement: no question and no request, and it tells something (about the
  user, the assistant, or something that happened).
- A request to make something: write, teach, quiz, plan, translate, "give me a
  word of the day". Its subject is ours to produce, not to find, unless it is
  the news or the weather.
- A question about us: "how is your day going", "what should I cook tonight".

A bare topic ("latest news about Ethiopia", "bitcoin price today") is a lookup
typed short and stays searchable.
