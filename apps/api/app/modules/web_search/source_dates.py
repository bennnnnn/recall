"""Dates in a search result, read against the user's today before the model reads them.

On 2026-10-24, "is the Pixel 11 out yet?" was answered "No, it isn't out yet" on 10 turns
in 12, from results that said "wide availability on August 20, 2026". The model compares
dates badly. Two things are now worked out here instead:

- Each dated day in a result says how long ago it was, or how far ahead: "August 20,
  2026 (2 months ago)".
- A page that calls a time still to come was written before it. Markets Insider said
  the phone "is expected to arrive sometime in the summer of 2026, most likely during an
  August launch event". Once that time has passed, the hit starts with a note saying so,
  and the model reads the page as the forecast it was. Only a time named after the
  looking-ahead words counts: "released August 20, 2026, and expected to get seven years
  of updates" is a page from after the release.

The phone's source cards keep the page's own words.
