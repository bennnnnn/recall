"""A message that works on the chat itself: nothing on the web answers it.

In one study chat (2026-10-24) the reply's own ``web_search`` tool ran for three such
messages and wrapped each answer in pages it had nothing to do with:

- "Yes" to "Does that make sense? 😊" searched the word and asked about the band Yes;
- "sure give me a practice problem" attached pre-calculus PDFs and GED videos to a
  Charles's-law problem;
- "ok im done studying for today. can you summarize what we covered?" attached exam-tip
  videos to the recap.

Two shapes, each read whole so a live ask beside one still searches:

- an answer to the last reply's check ("Does that make sense?", "Ready for the next
  one?", "Want a practice problem?"), where a yes, a "got it" or "still confused" is
  about the chat. A yes to any other question, an offer to look something up included
  ("Want the full box score?"), is left to the search rules;
- a request whose last sentence asks the chat to make or redo something: a practice
  problem, another one, a quiz, a recap of what was covered, the last answer again.
  "One more question: what's the weather tomorrow?" and "walk me through the visa
  rules for Kenya" ask something else.
