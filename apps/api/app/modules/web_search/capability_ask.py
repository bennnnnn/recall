"""A yes/no question about whether Recall searches: "can you search the web?".

"Show me how u work", then "Can you search the web?" (live chat, 2026-10-25): the
question read as a search request that names nothing, so the turn searched the line
before it and showed song lyrics. A question about the app asks nothing to look up;
the reply says what Recall can do. A request that names what to search ("can you
search for the latest news on Tesla?") or points at the chat ("can you look it up?",
"can you search the web for that?") is not this question and still searches.

A positive grammar over tokens, no regex over chat text: an opener, a question lead,
one verb of searching and words that only say where or what kind ("the web", "things",
"online"). A word outside it leaves the message to the search rules.
