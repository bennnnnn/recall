"""A search hit about a much older model of the thing a release question names.

"Is iPhone 19 out?" searched well, but two of its five sources were "Apple to Release
iPhone 6 Models Sept. 19" (2014) and "Apple iPhone 3GS Sold Out? Nope!" (2009): the
engine matched "iPhone", "19" and "out". A hit whose every model of the asked product
is more than two generations older (iPhone 6, iPhone 3GS) goes. A page about a near or
newer model stays: Wikipedia's list ending at the iPhone 17 and Apple's store selling the
iPhone 18 are how a reply knows the 19 is not out, and dropping them left none. So does
a hit naming the asked model or no model; years are not model numbers. When every hit
would go, all stay: a reply with sources beats "I couldn't verify that".
