"""Plans, features and per-plan allowances: the one place plan policy lives.

Three plans: ``free``, ``plus`` (the lower paid plan) and ``pro`` (the top
plan). Display names ("Plus", "Pro") live only in the app's i18n; the server
speaks in plan ids.

Every number is a ``core/config.py`` setting, named ``<base>`` for free,
``<base>_plus`` and ``<base>_pro``. A metered feature is part of a plan when
that plan's allowance is above zero, so moving a feature between plans is a
config change, not a code change. Callers ask ``can_use(user, feature)`` and
``allowance(user, name)``; nothing else reads ``user.plan``.

Kept free of heavy imports: schemas and quota code import it.
