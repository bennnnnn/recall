"""The one memory line a lesson chat keeps: "Learning Python: reached Lesson 3, ...".

Extraction reads only what the user says, so what was taught would never reach
memory. A new chat's "teach me python" reads this line to offer picking up
where the learner stopped. It is an ordinary fact: shown on the Memory page,
editable and deletable. A chat finds its line again by source chat and the
heading before the colon, and rewrites it in place after each lesson.
