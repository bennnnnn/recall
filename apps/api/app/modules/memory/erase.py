"""Removing a fact end to end: its older versions, and the chat snippets that repeat it.

Deleting "User lives in Lisbon" also deletes the "User lives in Nairobi" row it
superseded, and drops the past-chat snippets that would put either back into a
prompt through chat-history recall. The snippets are purged from the recall index
when the fact goes (one write, nothing to check on later turns); the messages stay
in their chats. Callers own the transaction.
