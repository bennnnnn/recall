"""Which memories go into a prompt, in what order, and how they're rendered.

Pure ranking and formatting — no Redis, no DB, no awaits. The stateful core
(`app/modules/memory/surface.py`) imports these into its own namespace and
calls them there, so tests patching `app.modules.memory.format_memory_block`
and friends still intercept the internal calls.
