A product is one row. Its outputs are expressions over its input names, in the closed
language of ``services/law_binding/expression.py``: the server works the asked numbers
with them and the phone redraws the card from the same trees (docs/money.md). Nothing
else branches on a product's name, so a new product is a new row, and a kind of one
priced apart (a used car) is a ``Variant`` on its row.

Rates are yearly percentages (``rate`` 6.5 is 6.5 %), compounded monthly, and payments
