"""A loan told over two lines: what the user is buying, then its amount and rate.

Live (2026-10-25): "I am planing to buy a car", the reply asking new or used and the
budget, then "20k with 6 percent". Neither line is a request on its own (``read`` needs
the product, the amount and the rate in one line), so no card was built and the model's
own totals were off ($1,930 interest where 20k at 6% over 36 months is $1,904).

Both lines are read by a positive grammar: every word belongs to a known phrase, and any
other word means the line is not this, and the model answers it as before.

- The user's line before says they are buying what a loan product finances
  (``Product.goods``): "I am planning to buy a car", "we want to buy a used car", "buying
  a house for 400k", "House buying for 400k", "car shopping for 20k", "I'm house hunting",
  "shopping for a car", "I'm getting a 30k truck next month". Not "I bought a car last
  week", "buy a house in minecraft", "buying a car for my son" or "car shopping for 3
  hours".
- With no price there, this line is only an amount and a rate, and maybe a term: "20k
  with 6 percent", "$20,000 at 6% apr", "20k at 6% for 5 years". The amount is what they
  will pay for it, financed whole, so a down payment told after it comes off it.
- With a price there, an amount said to be down comes off it ("60k down at 6%", "with 60k
  down", "down payment of 60k at 6 percent"). A bare amount may be either: "60k at 6
  percent" after "House buying for 400k" (live) was the down payment the reply had asked
  for. A third of the price or less is read as the down payment, two thirds or more as
  the loan; between, it stays with the model. A year ("2026 at 6%") and a sum under 1,000
  are never read as either. The reply's note says how it was read
  (``guessed``), so a misread shows, and the amount slider puts it right.

A down payment on its own line after the loan ("down payment 3k" after "20k with 6
percent") is a change of that loan, read by ``change_line`` and worked in ``follow_up``.
