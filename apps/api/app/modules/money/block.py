"""The money block the model reads before the user's message: numbers to copy, never redo.

The model writes the answer's words; the app worked the numbers and adds the market note
and the calculator card under the reply, so the block tells it not to write either. A
follow-up ("what if i only do 3 years instead") gets the earlier request worked again with
its change, and is told those are the answer: the free model once redid the change from
the earlier reply's numbers and was off by dollars (live, 2026-10-25).
