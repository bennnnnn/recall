"""Every sum of money in a request, with what its neighbours say it is.

"Borrow 20k" is borrowed, "costs 250,000" a price, "50,000 which he will use as a deposit"
money down, "200 a month" monthly, "my salary is 90,000" an income. ``loan_sums`` decides
from these which sum a loan is. Some numbers next to a currency are no sum at all: an
exchange rate ("USD 1 = ETB 57", "57 birr to the dollar"), a note or coin ("Birr 500
notes"), the same sum said again in another currency ("that's about USD 21,600") or a
plan's name ("my 401k").

A sum is read whole or not at all: digits left over ("25.000" read as 25.00) mean the
message holds a sum the reader cannot read, and ``amounts`` gives None: no numbers are
worked from it.
