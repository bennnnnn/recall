"""One follow-up line read by a positive grammar: a new term, rate or down payment, or nothing.

The server works three changes only, the ones that are both common and safe: the live
"hmm what if i only do 3 years instead", the live "Down payment 3k" (after a car loan of
20k at 6%, the model's own payment was 50 cents off) and the app's own follow-up chips.

- A term: "3 years", "36 months", "over 4 years", "a 15 year mortgage", "pay it off in 2
  years" (and, for savings, "save for 20 years").
- A rate with its words: "at 6%", "6% apr", "6% interest", "the rate is 6%", "a 6% rate".
- A down payment, a sum with its words: "down payment 3k", "down payment of 3,000", "with
  5000 down", a put still to come ("I can put 3 grand down", "I'm putting 3k down", "what
  if I put 3k down"), or "3k down" opening the line or after a change frame. Not one gone
  by or only talked about ("I put 3k down", "it was 3k down", "is it 3k down"), a year
  ("down payment 2026") or a percent down ("20% down"): the model answers those.

The line must ask for a change: it opens (after "hmm", "ok", "so") with "what if", "what
about", "how about", "and", "or", "make it", "try", "do", "go with" or "i only do", or it
ends with "instead" or "instead of N". A down payment needs no such frame: its own words
say it is one. Every other word must belong to a term or rate
phrase or be filler; any word left over means the line is about something else, and the
model answers it as before. Four reviews (2026-10-25) of wider readers found shapes they
misread into numbers the reply then called the answer: a model year as a price, a card
payment as an APR, "it's been 5 years" as a 5-year mortgage, "what's 7%?" as a new rate.
