"""Read a money request from the user's words: which product, and the numbers they gave.

"what is my mortgage for 300k dollars house if mr rate is 1 percent" is a mortgage of
300 000 USD at 1 %, its term left to the product's default. The reader is word rules
only, no model call, and it reads nothing it cannot find: a missing number stays
missing for ``solve`` to fill from a default or today's average, or for the model to ask.

A product word alone is not a request ("I'm saving for a house", "credit card design"):
the message also needs a rate, an amount with a loan word, or a question about today's
rates. Yearly simple or compound interest ("compound interest on 1000 at 5% for 3
years") is maths homework and stays with maths.

The kind of the product is read by ``kinds`` ("buying a used car" is looked up at the
used-car average), each sum's role by ``sums`` and the loan among them by ``loan_sums``.
The percent and the length of time (``phrases``) are shared with ``change_line``, which
reads a follow-up ("what if i only do 3 years instead") by its own stricter grammar.
