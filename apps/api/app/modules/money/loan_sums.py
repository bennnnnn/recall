"""Which sum in a loan request is the loan: the one borrowed, or the price less what is put
down, or none.

Live (2026-10-31, an Ethiopian grade 12 book): "a house that costs Birr 250,000. He has
saved Birr 50,000 which he will use as a deposit, and will finance the rest of the cost
by taking out a loan" was worked as a loan of 250,000, the first sum, and the card's
payment was the price's.

- A sum said to be borrowed or owed ("still owe 20k", "I borrowed $20,000") is the loan as
  it stands: money put down came off it already.
- Otherwise the loan is the price less the sum put down, said as a down payment or a
  deposit (also in a clause after it, "which he will use as a deposit"), or as paid toward
  it when "the rest" is borrowed ("she pays $5,000 and borrows the rest").
- Two sums with one said to be a price and none borrowed or named a loan say no loan
  ("the difference between a $300,000 house and a $350,000 house"): none is read, and the
  model answers. An income ("my salary is $90,000") is never a candidate.
