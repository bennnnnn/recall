"""A turn about the chat's loan that builds no card of its own: the loan's figures, the app's.

Live (2026-10-25): "House buying for 400k" then "60k at 6 percent" (card: 340,000 at 6% over
30 years, $2,038.47 a month), then "How", "Yes" and "Yes", the last taking the reply's
offer of a 15-year comparison. No line after the card was a money request, so the model
worked the 15-year loan itself: $2,921.00 a month and $185,780.00 interest, where the loan
costs $2,869.11 and $176,440.38.

While the chat's last money request stands in the user's recent lines
(``follow_up.standing_request``) and this message is about that loan (``about_the_loan``),
the model reads the loan's figures at its own term and the common others
(``block.standing_block``). A message is about the loan when it names the loan's own
subject (its payment, interest, rate, term, "the loan", "the mortgage", a term with a
number) or asks for its maths, or when it is a short "yes" / "how" right after a reply
whose last sentence offered something about the loan. The reply's own sums are never
rewritten: a review (2026-10-26) found a nearness test turned rent, budgets, other
principals and totals with taxes into the loan's figures.
