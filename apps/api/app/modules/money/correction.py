"""A line that says what a guessed amount was: the guess put right.

After "House buying for 400k" and "60k at 6 percent", the reply reads 60k as the down
payment and says so ("Read as: 60,000 is the down payment …", ``purchase``). "No, 60k is
the loan", "the loan is 60k" and "it's the loan" make it a loan of 60k with no price;
"it's the down payment" after a guessed loan makes it the down payment. Read by a
positive grammar: the whole line is one of these, and a sum it names is the guessed one.
