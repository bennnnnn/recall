"""A law's name as the heading over its formulas: **Constant acceleration**, not **Formula**.

The catalog names a law the way a textbook index does ("Kinetic-energy formula",
"SUVAT constant-acceleration equation"). Over the formula itself, "formula" or
"equation" says nothing the rows below do not, so the heading keeps what the law
is about: "Kinetic energy", "Constant acceleration". A law named for itself
("Snell's law", "Continuity equation", "Stefan-Boltzmann law") keeps its name.
