"""The `simulation` fence — a scene of moving bodies, not an x-y plot.

P3 animated the trajectory *graph*, which answers "what shape is the path" but
not "what is actually moving, and what is pulling on it". Seven of the eleven
verified physics kinds draw nothing at all, and for several the picture is the
explanation: an orbiting dot is the most natural animation in the subject, and
a number cannot show a momentum transfer.

`GraphBlockSpec` cannot express any of that. It is an x-y plot with axes, one
curve and a pair of axis labels; a scene needs bodies with sizes, a ground, and
force vectors that point somewhere in the world rather than along an axis.

What is deliberately *not* here: velocities, masses, forces as numbers, or
anything else the renderer would have to do physics with. Every body carries a
**sampled path** in world units, exactly as the trajectory graph carries sampled
points, and the index is the clock. The client walks the array. Nothing on the
device re-derives motion — the same rule that governs the math pipeline.
