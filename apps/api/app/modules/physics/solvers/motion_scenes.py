"""Scenes for motion under gravity: a projectile's arc and a vertical fall.

One picture per question. The arc carries its range and height as measure
lines and its launch angle as an arc, so the trajectory graph it used to sit
beside said nothing the scene does not; a fall carries the ledge it leaves and
the height it drops. Every coordinate is a sample of the solved motion, so the
ball is never somewhere the answer says it is not. A question about a fall's
speed also gets its v-t line, a different view of it (`fall_speed_pictures`).
