"""A result the student states as theirs: a value to check, never a given.

"A 2 kg ball is dropped from 20 m. I got 19.8 m/s for its impact speed. Am I
right?" was solved with v₀ = 19.8 m/s and answered 28 m/s; the student was
right. A claimed value is taken out of the question before anything reads its
givens, and when the claim was the only ask, it becomes one: the quantity it
names, or the kind of its unit ("I got 3 A" asks for a current).

Two shapes are claims:

- a statement of one's own result: "I got", "I calculated", "my answer is",
  "my friend says";
- a yes/no question about a value: "Does it hit the ground at 19.8 m/s?",
  "Is its final speed more than 10 m/s?".

The direct reply says whether a stated result matches the verified one
(``claim_verdict``). A yes/no question is left to the model, with the check.
