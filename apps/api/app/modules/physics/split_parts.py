"""A question in parts the solver reads one part of: each part solved on its own.

"A crane lifts a 450 kg concrete to the top of a 50 m building in 5 s … a) The potential
energy of the concrete. b) The power developed by the crane" was solved for the energy
alone, and that one card sat under the reply's last Answer as if it answered both
(2026-10-29, a grade 7 physics book). The solver reads one ask, so each part is read
alone: the question's givens with that part's ask, or the question up to that ask. Every
part must solve, each to a different answer, or nothing here is used.

Two parts asking for the same kind of quantity ("the normal reaction force" and "the
frictional force", both newtons) are only taken when each part brings numbers of its
own ("the earth, where g = 10 m/s²", "the moon, where g = 1.6 m/s²"): a dimension does
not tell a normal force from a friction, and the friction answered both.
