"""Physics-owned reconciliation of answer, trajectory, and simulation fences.

On a verified turn the model's own result fences are dropped, the solver's
card (marked ``verified: true``) lands under the reply's **Answer** heading in
place of the model's final line, and the scene is appended. A reply that answers
and then offers more ("Want the max height too?") keeps both; only a reply that
asks instead of stating any result goes without. A final value in the prose
that differs from the verified one gets one correction line above the card.
