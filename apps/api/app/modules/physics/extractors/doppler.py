"""Doppler questions: who moves, toward whom, and how fast sound travels.

The formula needs each party's speed with a sign (toward the other is
positive), so the reading is by role. A party the question calls stationary
has speed 0 and the one stated speed belongs to the other. "Moves at 20 m/s"
with no direction, two speeds for one role, or a direction the words do not
settle all decline. A stated speed of sound replaces the 343 m/s default.
