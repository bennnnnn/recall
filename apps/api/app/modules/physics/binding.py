"""Read a question straight into a physics catalog operation, from its givens and its ask.

The extractors are written for the phrasings they know. Many questions just
state a law's inputs and ask for its result in words the catalog can list:
"accelerates from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 5 s. Find its acceleration." The binder
reads the asked clause (``ask``), finds every operation whose ``Binding`` names
that ask, and fills each from the stated values with the shared engine
(``services.law_binding.fit``), with physics' settings for an unstated input
(g, the named planet's mass).

Anything short of one operation with one way to fill it declines: two
operations fit, a value has no input, an input could take either of two
values, or the ask names nothing the catalog lists. It runs after the
extractors, so it only answers questions they declined.
