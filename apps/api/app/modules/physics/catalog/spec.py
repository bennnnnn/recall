"""One verified physics operation: the law, its variables, and its assumptions.

Solvers still own word-problem procedure. This record owns the identity those
procedures used to repeat in the direct-reply dictionaries.

An operation with a ``binding`` can also be read straight from a question by
``physics.binding``: the binding says how a question asks for the result, and
each variable says how a question names it. An operation with an
``expression`` needs no solver of its own; ``physics.expression`` evaluates it.
