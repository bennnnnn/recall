"""How many things a question asks for, so an instant reply never drops one.

"A ball is dropped from 45 m. (a) How long does it take to hit the ground?
(b) How fast is it going when it lands?" was answered (b) alone, instantly, and
the model never saw the question, so (a) was never answered. A question whose
asks outnumber what the verified result answers goes to the model, with the
verified part as its block.
