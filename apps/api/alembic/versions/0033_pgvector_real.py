"""Real pgvector: vector column + HNSW index for semantic memory recall.

Replaces the prior app-side JSON-cosine approach with a real `vector(1536)`
column (matches openai/text-embedding-3-small) and an HNSW index for DB-side
cosine similarity ordering. The legacy `embedding_json` Text column is kept as
a fallback and for the backfill below.

On systems without the pgvector extension (e.g., CI test databases), the
vector features are skipped — the app falls back to in-memory JSON cosine.
