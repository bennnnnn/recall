"""Record when an attachment was first linked, and index the attachment lookups.

Revision ID: 0114_attachment_linked_at
Revises: 0113_product_event_names

An upload confirmed but never sent kept ``message_id`` NULL forever, exactly like a
Library item whose chat was deleted, so the orphan reaper could not tell them
apart and kept both. ``linked_at`` is set the first time a message links the row.
Existing rows cannot say whether they were ever linked, so every linked or
verified row is backfilled as linked: only uploads from now on can be reaped as
never sent. Adding a nullable column is an expand; the old release ignores it.

The indexes serve a message delete (FK SET NULL on ``message_id``), a chat delete
(FK CASCADE on ``attachment_chunks.chat_id``) and the reaper's scan of unlinked
rows by age. They are built CONCURRENTLY so writes keep flowing during the build.
