/**
 * Disarms `<meta http-equiv>` pragmas in untrusted HTML: the preview's Run tab and the
 * browser export (lib/previewSandbox.ts).
 *
 * A pragma acts without any script. `refresh` sends the page elsewhere with no tap,
 * `set-cookie` writes a cookie, `content-security-policy` adds a policy,
 * `x-dns-prefetch-control: on` turns on DNS lookups that no CSP governs, `content-type`
 * declares a charset and `default-style` picks a stylesheet. A preview needs none of
 * them (its charset comes from how it is loaded), so every one goes; the only pragma a
 * preview keeps is the CSP the app writes itself (`keep`).
 *
 * Each tag is read the way the HTML tokenizer reads it: "/" separates attributes as
 * whitespace does, a quoted value may hold ">", and names match in any case. Character
 * references are never decoded in a name, so the value is never read: an encoded
 * `&#114;efresh` goes like any other.
 *
 * The attribute is renamed, not deleted. Deleting text lets the pieces either side of it
 * join into a new tag (`<scr<meta http-equiv=refresh>ipt>` became a live `<script>`);
 * renaming moves no tag boundary, so the rest of the document parses exactly as before
 * and one pass is final.
