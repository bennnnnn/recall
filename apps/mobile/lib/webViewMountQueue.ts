/**
 * Module-level slot queue that gates how many WebView-based rich blocks
 * (chart/vega, mermaid diagrams, heavy multi-line math) may mount at the
 * same time.
 *
 * FlashList already virtualizes at the message-row level (off-screen rows
 * unmount), but a single *visible* assistant reply can contain several rich
 * fences — each one mounting its own `react-native-webview` instance the
 * moment the row renders. Charts and mermaid diagrams each independently
 * fetch 1MB+ of JS from a CDN, and even math (no CDN fetch) pays a WebView
 * shell native-memory cost — so N fences in one message means N simultaneous
 * mounts/fetches in the same frame. This queue staggers that: callers
 * request a ticket, wait for it to be granted (subscribe), and release it
 * once their WebView has loaded (or unmounts before loading), freeing the
 * slot for the next waiter.
 *
 * Kept framework-free (no React) so the allocation logic is unit-testable
 * without rendering anything — see hooks/useDeferredWebViewMount.ts for the
 * React wrapper that consuming components actually use. Pattern mirrors
 * lib/streamingDraftStore.ts: private module-level state + a listeners set
 * that gets notified on every change.
