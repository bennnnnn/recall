/**
 * Server-owned answer fences open with header lines, then the value.
 *
 * - `verified: true` — the server checked this value with a solver. It is the only
 *   thing that earns the card's green check; the server strips the line from anything
 *   a model writes, so a reply cannot forge it.
 * - `notation: chemistry` — the body is chemistry text, not LaTeX. Chemistry (and any
 *   later literal subject) keeps formulas, charges, and units as text; treating that
 *   body as algebra rewrites a correct result.
 * - `label: answer` — older replies carry it; every card draws "Answer" now, so it is
 *   read as a header and dropped.
 * - `part: a` — the card answers one part of a question in parts; it draws "Answer (a)".
 *   The phone writes it from the "**Answer (a)**" heading above the card
 *   (lib/markdown/attachAnswerHeading.ts).
 *
 * The value is the final answer alone: a calculation before it (`4 × 4 = 16`) is
 * working and left out (lib/cardValue.ts), on old cards too.
