 * Trades the phone's WebRTC offer for OpenAI's answer through Recall's API
 * (`POST /speech/live/connect`). The server opens the call with the session's
 * short-lived secret, which never reaches the phone, so it knows the call and
 * hangs it up itself when the session ends or its minutes run out. Only the
 * media then flows directly between the phone and OpenAI.
 *
 * A refusal keeps the server's status and code: its `upstream_failed` (OpenAI
 * opened no call) reads as a failed connection, `live_talk_session_ended` as
 * the session being over. A hang-up (`signal`) cancels the request: the server never opens a
 * call for a phone that left.
